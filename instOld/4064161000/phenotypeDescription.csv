4064161000,Cirrhosis of liver,4064161,"Overview: Cirrhosis is progressive hepatic fibrosis with distortion of liver architecture with the formation of regeneration nodules. This is an irreversible and advanced stage of liver damage with reduction in liver function.Presentation: most commonly non-specific with pruritis, weight loss, weakness, fatigure. In some cases there may hepatic decompensation related symptoms like encephalopathy, portal hypertension related ascities, gastroesophageal bleeding.Assessment: elevated liver enzymes, ultrasound liver. Liver biopsy to confirm presence of cirrhosis. Reduced platelet count, increase PT/INR, low albumin to globulin ratio suggest advanced disease. Plan: Portal hypertension related complications are common such as variceal bleeding (hematemis, melena), ascities, spontaneous bacterial peritonitiis - these may require surgical management. Prevent Hepatic encephalopathy using lactulose/rifaximin. Treat any underlying viral hepatitis. Maintain compensated cirrhosis.Prognosis: poor if decompensated cirrhosis. May recover with liver transplantation.",,
