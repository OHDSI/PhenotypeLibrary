A curated library generated by the OHDSI community on phenotypes and
cohort definitions. The definitions are expressed in JSON and SQL (OHDSI
SQL) instructions and are compatible with OHDSI analytic tools and OHDSI
OMOP CDM v5.0+. To be in the library, the definitions must have gone
through diagnostics using OHDSI tools such as CohortDiagnostics and
PheValuator. Supporting content are in folders literature, notes and
evaluation. Studies may be executed by importing the definitions into
OHDSI tools and compiling study executable (see
<https://github.com/OHDSI-studies>).
