80204000,Fetal growth restriction,"Overview: aka - intrauterine growth restriction IUGR. When a fetus fails to reach it's biological growth potential due to environmental factors including placental dysfunction. There is discrepancies between actual and expected sonographic biometric measurements for a given gestational age. Traditionally, it has been defined as <10th percentile weight for gestational age on a singleton growth curve, as this establishes the diagnosis as being small for gestational age (SGA). Distinct from ""small for gestational age"" (which is caused by constitutionally small fetus or congenital/intrinsic non environmental fetal causes). Presentation: Most commonly detected in natal ultrasound - mismatch between pregnancy dates and fetal growth on ultrasound. sometimes associated with inadequate weight gain during pregnancy. Assessment: Serial ultrasounds to evaluate the fetus, placenta, amniotic fluid index, and umbilical artery dopplers. Plan: find the cause. Genetic causes. Evaluate for infections. Antiphospholipid syndrome. Manage reversible causes of growth restriction (stop smoking, treat infections), nonstress testing, correct nutritional deficiencies such as iron, treat any infections present, treat high blood pressure. Prognosis: If umbilical artery function critically low, preterm delivery is indicated. Can result in intrauterine fetal demise. Stillbirth, neonatal death, neonatal morbidity, and abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome in perinatal region. Long-term as child grows, commonly associated with cardiovascular, metabolic endocrine disease/dysfunction.","{
