80204000,Fetal growth restriction,80204,"Overview: When a fetus fails to reach it's biological growth potential due to placental dysfunction. Distinct from ""small for gestational age"" (which is caused by non-placental etiologies such as a constitutionally small etus or congenital causes) Presentation: mismatch between pregnancy dates and fetal growth on ultrasound. sometimes associated with inadequate weight gain during pregnancy. Assessment: Serial ultrasounds to evaluate the fetus, placenta, amniotic fluid index, and umbilical artery dopplers. Plan: Manage reversible causes of growth restriction (stop smoking, treat infections), nonstress testing, correct nutritional deficiencies such as iron, treat any infections present, treat high blood pressure. Prognosis: If umbilical artery function critically low, preterm delivery is indicated. Can result in intrauterine fetal demise.",NA,NA
80204000,Fetal growth restriction,80204,"Overview: discrepancies between actual and expected sonographic biometric measurements for a given gestational age. Traditionally, it has been defined as <10th percentile weight for gestational age on a singleton growth curve, as this establishes the diagnosis as being small for gestational age (SGA). Presentation: Most commonly detected in natal ultrasound. Plan: find the cause. Genetic causes. Evaluate for infections. Antiphospholipid syndrome. Prognosis: Stillbirth, neonatal death, neonatal morbidity, and abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome in perinatal region. Long-term as child grows, commonly associated with cardiovascular, metabolic endocrine disease/dysfunction.",NA,NA
