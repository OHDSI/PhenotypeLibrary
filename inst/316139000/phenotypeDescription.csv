316139000,Heart failure,316139,"Overview: Heart Failure is a clinical syndrome of dyspnea, fatigue and fluid retention because of the inability of the heart to pump sufficient blood to meet the body metabolic needs.Presentation: Progressive dyspnea, paroxysmal noctural dysnpnea, orthopnea, abdominal or peripheral congestion/edema, tiredness, dizziness. In some cases of chronic compensated heart failure, the patient may be asymptomaticAssessment: Evaluate the cause with extensive investigation on incident acute heart failure. BNP, ProBNP, ECG, ECHO to measure ejection fraction and wall motion abnormalities, CXR, catheterization, stress test, sleep study etc. Assess grade based on NYHAPlan: care cordination and cardiac rehabilitation, goal of treatment is to improve quality of life and reduce hospitalization, slow progression. Diuretics, beta blockers, ACE-/ARBs are part of initial therapy. Manage complications such as arrythmia with need for defibrillator and anticoagulants, heart transplantPrognosis: depends on grade, progression and presence of complications. Life long chronic disease. If well managed, can lead to compensated aymptomatic state.Recommendation: For use of generic term, 'heart failure' consider the cohort definition for 'acute decompensated left heart failure' that is managed as an emergency. The other cohort definition options include chronic stable compensated left heart failure, corpulmonale (right heart failure) with pulmonary hypertension.","",""
