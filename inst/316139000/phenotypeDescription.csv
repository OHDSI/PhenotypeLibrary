316139000,Heart failure,"Overview: For use of generic term, 'heart failure' consider the cohort definition for 'acute decompensated left heart failure' that is managed as an emergency. The other cohort definition options include chronic stable compensated left heart failure, corpulmonale (right heart failure) with pulmonary hypertension. Heart Failure is a clinical syndrome of dyspnea, fatigue and fluid retention because of the inability of the heart to pump sufficient blood to meet the  metabolic demands of peripheral tissues, or ability to do so only at abnormally high cardiac filling pressures. Classified in many ways, low output vs high output cardiac failure, left-side vs right-side cardiac failure, backward vs forwad cardiac failure, systolic vs diastolic cardiac failure, based on ejection fraction (< 40%, 40 to 49%, >= 50% HF with presevered ejection fraction), functional level (Class 1 to 4 - symptoms at rest). Congestive heart failure is left-sided heart failure and is associated with pulmonary edema. Presentation: From pulmonary edema such as Progressive dyspnea, paroxysmal noctural dysnpnea, orthopnea, abdominal or peripheral congestion/edema, tiredness, dizziness. In some cases of chronic compensated heart failure, the patient may be asymptomatic. Assessment: Evaluate the cause (including precipitating cause if acute on chronic) with extensive investigation on incident acute heart failure. BNP, ProBNP, ECG, ECHO to measure ejection fraction and wall motion abnormalities, CXR, catheterization, stress test, sleep study etc. Assess grade based on NYHA. Plan: depends on the type of cardiac failure. Congestive heart failure - diuresis, morphine, nitrates, oxygen NIV, position. For low perfusion - inotropes, mechanical support. In addition care cordination and cardiac rehabilitation, goal of treatment is to improve quality of life and reduce hospitalization, slow progression. Diuretics, beta blockers, ACE-/ARBs are part of initial therapy. Manage complications such as arrythmia with need for defibrillator and anticoagulants, heart transplant. Prognosis: depends on grade, progression and presence of complications. Life long chronic disease. If well managed, can lead to compensated aymptomatic state."
