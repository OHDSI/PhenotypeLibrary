44784217000,Cardiac arrhythmia,44784217,"Overview: An abnormality in the normal activation or beating of the heart myocardium. Divided into tachyarrhythmias (rapid), bradyarrhythmias(slow), Presentation: Sensation of palpitations, syncope, lightheadedness or dizziness, poor exercise tolerance. Assessment: ECG, Holter Monitor, CBC to rule out anemia, TSH to rule out thyroid disease, lipids, liver tests, clotting tests, BNP to evaluate heart failure, echocardiogram to evaluate for structural heart disease. CMP. Plan: Treated according to location of the pathology including medications, pacemaker, defibrillator, radiofrequency catheter ablation, external cardioversion, vagal maneuver for sinus tachycardias. Treatment of underlying disease such as anemia or thyrotoxicosis frequently resolves the arrhythmia. Prognosis: When identified early in the course of disease process, good. If not treated, can lead to increased risk of stroke (due to atrial fibrillation), heart failure, death.",NA,NA
