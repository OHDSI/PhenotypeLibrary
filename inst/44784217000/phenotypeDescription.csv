44784217000,Cardiac arrhythmia,"Overview: Normal sinus heart rate originates from the sinus node 60-100 beats (sinus arrythmia -normal arrythmia, sinus tachycardia, sinus bradycardia). An arrhythmia is any rhythm that is not normal sinus rhythm with normal atrioventricular (AV) conduction. Arrythmias are classified in many ways based on rate - tachyarrhythmias vs bradyarrhythmias, regularity (regular vs irregular), location/type of origin (atrial vs ventricular, reentrant), or based on wall motion (flutter vs fibrillation). Common arrythmias (supraventricular - atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, non sinus atrial trachycardia ectopic/reentry/premature beats), AV junction (reentry tachycardia, extrasystoles), Ventricular (sustained/non sustained tachycaria, fibrillation, extrasystole/premature beats). Presentation: Symptom type and severity depends on the type, etiology and rate of arrythmia - symptoms dictates urgency of presentation. Sensation of palpitations, syncope, lightheadedness or dizziness, poor exercise tolerance. Assessment: ECG, Holter ambulatory monitor, CBC to rule out anemia, TSH to rule out thyroid disease, lipids, liver tests, clotting tests, electrolyte CMP especially potassium, BNP to evaluate heart failure, echocardiogram to evaluate for structural heart disease. Plan: Treated according to location of the pathology including medications, pacemaker, defibrillator, radiofrequency catheter ablation, external cardioversion - conversion to sinus rythym, vagal maneuver for sinus tachycardias. Treatment of underlying disease such as anemia or thyrotoxicosis frequently resolves the arrhythmia. Prognosis: When identified early in the course of disease process, good. If not treated, can lead to increased risk of stroke (due to atrial fibrillation), heart failure, death. Specialist involvement recommended for anti arrythmic drug management.","{
