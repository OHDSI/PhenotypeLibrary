440417000,Pulmonary embolism,"Overview: Pulmonary embolus (PE) refers to obstruction/blockade of pulmonary artery or one of its branches by material (eg, thrombus, tumor, air, or fat) that originated elsewhere in the body (embolism). Temporally PE is classified into acute (presenting immediately after obstruction), subacute (within days or weeks following event), chronic (over many years, ie, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension; CTEPH - uncommon). Unless otherwise specified, the general useage of the term pulmonary embolism implies 'acute' PE. Acute PE is further classified based on hemodynamic stability into unstable/massive/high-risk PE if hemodynamically unstable (hypotension), hemodynamically stable with right ventricular strain submassive/intermediate-risk PE, hemodynamically stable and no evidence of right ventricular strain low-risk PE. It is also classified based on the location of the emboli - saddle PE, main lobar, segmental or subsegmental. Most emboli are thought to originate from lower extremity proximal veins (iliac, femoral, and popliteal). Presentation: Highly variable and may occassionally be asymptomatic and found incidentally (especially chronic variant). Most commonly starts with a combination of chest pain (classically pleuritic in nature), cough, and symptoms of deep venous thrombosis. The symptoms of PE are secondary to pathophysiologic responses like tissue infarction, abnormal gas exchange, cardivascular compromise with sudden shortness of breath and chest pain - to shock and death. Assessment: Hard diagnosis in hemodynamically stable patients - often guided by prior probability based on at-risk (Wells criteria). D-dimer testing and definitive diagnostic imaging (CT pulmonary angiography). V/Q scan is less commonly used. If hemodynamically unstable, definitive diagnostic imaging may not be practical or safe. Plan: If hemodynamically unstable, resusistative efforts (oxygenation, stabilization, ventillatory support, hemodynamic support). Once diagnosis is confirmed, main therapy is anticoagulants (sometimes started prior to diagnosis when pretest probability is high). If the emboli is considered life threatening, then thrombolysis, inferior vena cava filters, or embolectomy surgery. Prognosis: Death may occur, but mortality is reduced with anticoagulation. Adequate long-term management may reduce recurrence of thromboembolism - better prognosis.","{
