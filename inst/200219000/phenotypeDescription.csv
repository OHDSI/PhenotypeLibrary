200219000,Abdominal pain,"Overview: Commonly classified into acute vs chronic - although there is no established definition to differentiate the two. Abdominal pain that is new in onset in past few days and may still be accelerating is generally considered acute. Presentation: pain is described by position, chronology (onset, duration, frequency), severity (scale 1 to 10), aggravating and reliving factors. Assement: If acute abdomen a determination needs to be made if this is an emergency (unstable vital signs, signs of peritonitis or perforation). Localized pain that is considered non urgent may have different management based on location e.g. right upper quadrant is investigated for liver/gall bladder disease, while epi gastric area pain is managed for gastritis/ulcer. Ultrasound of the abdomen or CT abdomen as needed. Plan: Depends on the underlying etiology. Prognosis: Abdominal pain is most commonly benign and self-limited."
