HIV causes AIDS and interferes with the body's ability to fight infections. The virus can be transmitted through contact with infected blood, semen, or vaginal fluids.Presentation: Flu-like symptoms such as fever, sore throat, and fatigue, swollen lymph nodes. Then the disease is usually asymptomatic until it progresses to AIDS. AIDS symptoms include weight loss, fever or night sweats, fatigue, and recurrent infections.Assessment: Signs and symptoms, history. CD4 count, viral count. AIDS is diagnosed when the CD4 count falls below 200 cells per microliter of blood or when extreme wasting or certain serious opportunistic infections or cancers develop.Plan: Prevention and screening. Antiretroviral drugs, prevent opportunistic infections, relieve symptoms Prognosis: Exposure to HIV does not always lead to infection, and some people who have had repeated exposures over many years remain uninfected. No effective HIV vaccine to prevent HIV infection or slow the progression of AIDS in people who are already infected. No cure exists for AIDS, but strict adherence to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) can dramatically slow the disease's progress, prevent secondary infections and complications, and prolong life.",NA,NA
