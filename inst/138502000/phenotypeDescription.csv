138502000,Vitiligo,"Overview: Vitiligo is the most frequent cause of acquired depigmentation disorder of skin that is characterized by development of well-defined white macules on the skin. Presentation: Vitiligo typically presents with asymptomatic patches of skin that is milky/chalky white in color without signs of inflammation. Although it can appear at any age or anywhere on the body, it has predilection for the face, around orifices, in genitals, and hands. Depigmentation of hair may also occur. Most commonly Vitiligo is non-segmental but can be segmental too especially around the trigeminal nerve distribution. Assessment: Clinical diagnosis is straightforward based on history and clinical examination. Routine skin biopsy is not needed. Plan: If rapid progression is suspected, low-dose oral corticosteroids. Phototherapy may cause stabilization. Prognosis: Clinical course is variable, may remain stable or slowly progress – with extent and distribution changing over lifetime.","{
