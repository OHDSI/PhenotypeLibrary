440940000,Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection,"Overview: A group of Gram-positive bacteria that are genetically distinct from other strains of Staphylococcus aureus. MRSA is responsible for several difficult-to-treat infections in humans. (MRSA) infection is caused by a type of staph bacteria that's become resistant to many of the antibiotics used to treat ordinary staph infections. Most MRSA infections occur in people who've been in hospitals or other health care settings, such as nursing homes and dialysis centers. When it occurs in these settings, it's known as health care-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA). Presentation: Depends on the part of the body that is infected. Staph skin infection - present with fever, swollen, painful red bumps that are warm to touch, can be full of pus or other drainage - turn into painful abscesses or burrow deep into the body (life-threatening infections)Assessment: Checking a tissue sample or nasal secretions for signs of drug-resistant bacteriaPlan: Antibiotics (IV), if skin boil - incisions and drainage; culturesPrognosis: MRSA infections can resist the effects of many common antibiotics, so they are more difficult to treat. This can allow the infections to spread and sometimes become life-threatening. MRSA is usually spread in the community by contact with infected people or things that are carrying the bacteria. Once the active infection goes away, you can still have MRSA on your skin and in the nose (MRSA carrier)."
