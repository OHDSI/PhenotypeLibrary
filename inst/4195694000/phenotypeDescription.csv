4195694000,Acute respiratory distress syndrome,"Overview: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an acute, diffuse, inflammatory form of lung injury. Presentation: progressive symptoms of dyspnea, increasing oxygen requirement, alveolar infiltrates on chest imaging within 72 hours of symptoms. In addition to respiratory symptoms, symptoms of inciting agent such as sepsis, trauma, smoke inhalation, pneumonia, inflammatory or autoimmune conditions, vasculitis etc. The presence of cardiac failure or fluid overload should not fully explain the symptoms. Assessment: physical exam, chest imaging, rule out cardiac causes (cardio pulmonary edema) with EKG +/- echo, BNP. Look for etiology/inciting agent. Bronchoscopy. Plan: Supportive care with management of hypoxemia with supplemental oxygenation including mechanical ventillation if needed. Sedation and analgesia if needed for ventillation. Hemodynamic monitoring and support. Glucose control. DVT prophylaxis. Infection control and prevention. Identify and remove inciting agent.  Prognosis: in short term may be progressive with complications if inciting agent is not removed. Complications may arise from mechanical ventillation. Delirium of critically ill may occur. In past had high mortality rate of about 50%, but has now declined. In long term, patients may have experience sequela from such complications or tissue injury."
