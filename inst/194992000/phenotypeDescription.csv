194992000,Celiac disease,194992,"Overview: Celiac disease is a type of gastrointestinal malabsorption condition associated with abdominal discomfort and diarrhoea, commonly caused by immune reaction to gluten in wheat containing diet.Initial presentation: Most common presentation at diagnosis include chronic or recurrent diarrhea or constipation, malabsorption (bulky, foul-smelling, floating stools due to steatorrhea), unexpected weight loss, abdominal pain, distension, flatulence or bloating. The severity of symptoms appears to correlate with both histologic severity and tissue transglutaminase titers. However, the disease spectrum ranges from no symptoms, relapsing symptoms, to severe debilitating symptoms.Assessment: Clinical judgment using combination of symptoms, prior probability of celiac disease based on clinical scenarios such as (decreases probability): absence of significant chronic diarrhea/steatorrhea or weight loss, absence of family history, being of Chinese, Japanese, or Sub-Saharan African descent. If prior probability is high, then serologic testing and small bowel biopsy may help with establishing diagnosis. Exclude other similar conditions like Irritable bowel syndrome, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, lactose intolerance, chronic pancreatitis, microscopic colitis, and inflammatory bowel disease.Plan: Diet management (gluten), symptom management.Prognosis: This is a life-long condition, although occasionally remission is possible after prolonger dietary treatment.",NA,NA
