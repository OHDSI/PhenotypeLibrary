255848000,Pneumonia,"Overview: Pneumonia is acute infection of pulmonary parenchyma. It is commonly dividied into two categories based on source of infection into Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) - most common and nosocomial (hospital) acquired pneumonia. Presentation: cough, fever, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, and sputum. Leukocytosis, consolidation/interstial infiltrates on chest X-ray. Atypical pneumonia (mycoplasma pneumonia have milder presentation with cough)Assessment: history of hospitalization to determine if noscomial pneumonia. Determine the need to hospitalize vs outpatinet management. Plan: targeted antimicrobials after isolating pathogen is preferred, but rarely practical. Blood cultures may be positive in many hospitalized. S. pneumoniae is most common bacterial, while Influenza is common for viral pneumonia. Prognosis: treatment may lead to good recovery","{
