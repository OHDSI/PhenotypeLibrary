4181351000,Ovarian cancer,"Overview: Abnormal cells in the ovary begin to multiply out of control and form a tumor. If left untreated, the tumor can spread to other parts of the body (metastatic ovarian cancer). Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most common type of ovarian cancer. Presentation: No symptoms in the early stages. Abdominal bloating, pressure and pain; increase in urination, fatigue, back pain, menstrual irregularities, painful intercourse. Later - weight loss, loss of appetite Assessment: Family history, no routine diagnostic screening, self-report of unusual or persistent symptoms; imaging tests (transvaginal ultrasound); abdominal and pelvic CT scans, cancer antigen 125 (CA-125 levels, biomarker), biopsy Plan: Surgery (hysterectomy) and chemotherapy, radiation. Hormone therapy. Prognosis: Ovarian cancer often goes undetected until it has spread within the pelvis and belly. At this late stage, ovarian cancer is more difficult to treat and can be fatal.","{
