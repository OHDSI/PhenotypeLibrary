Whenever possible, such patients are managed in the ICU with access to centers with active liver transplanation program. Presentation: Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, fatigue, diarrhea; yellowed skin and eyes (jaundice) along with belly pain and swelling; mental confusion (hepatic encephalopathy), easy bruising or bleeding. Assessment: serial laboratory tests are essential to monitor disease courese - monitor serum aminotransferases, bilirubin, hypoglycemia, electrolyte (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia), ammonia. Find the cause of liver injury . Plan: if acetaminophen poisoning, N-acetylcysteine. Bleeding prevention because of coagulopaty from failure of liver to synthesize clotting factors. Infection surveillance and prevention. Nutrition support in ICU. Mushroom amanita phalloides ingestion position treatment activated charcoal. Budd-chiari syndrome - transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement. Prognosis: medical emergency, and poor prognosis especially in the care at specialized centers - only minority will resolve spontaneously. Survial also depends on ensuing complications and its prevention/management.","{
