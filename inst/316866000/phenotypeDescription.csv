316866000,Hypertensive disorder,"Overview: A condition in which the force of the blood against the artery walls is too high. Elevated or increased blood pressure (BP); High blood pressure; Hypertension (HTN); Systemic hypertension. Primary (essential) hypertension and Seconday hypertension (caused by and underlying condition). Presentation: No signs and symptoms. can have headaches, SOB or nosebleeds (these occur when blood pressure reaches a severe stage). Assessment: Stage 1 HTN - systolic pressure ranging from 130 to 139 mm Hg or a diastolic pressure ranging from 80 to 89 mm Hg; and Stage 2 - systolic pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or a diastolic pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher. 2 - 3 BP readings each at three or more separate appointments before diagnosing. Plan: Lifestyle, medications - Thiazide diuretics, Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers, alpha-beta blockers (many other meds). Prognosis: If untreated, it can cause health conditions, such as heart disease and stroke.","{
