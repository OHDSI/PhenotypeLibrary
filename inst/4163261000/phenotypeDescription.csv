4163261000,Prostate cancer,4163261,"Overview: A cancer in a man's prostate, a small walnut-sized gland that produces seminal fluid. Prostate cancer begins when cells in the prostate gland start to grow out of control.Presentation: Difficulty with urination, trouble urinating, decreased force in the stream of urine, blood in semen, discomfort in the pelvic area, bone pain, and erectile dysfunction. Sometimes there are no symptoms at all. Assessment: The prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test and digital rectal examination (DRE) are two tests that are used to screen for prostate cancer. Only a biopsy can confirm the presence and type of cancer.Plan: In some of these cases, monitoring is recommended. Other types are aggressive and require radiation, surgery, hormone therapy, chemotherapy, or other treatments. Prognosis: Males with early stage prostate cancer have a good chance of effective treatment and survival. The 5-year survival rate for most men with local or regional prostate cancer is nearly 100%. For men diagnosed with prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, the 5-year survival rate is 31%. The 10-year survival rate for local, regional, and distant prostate cancer combined is 98%.",NA,NA
