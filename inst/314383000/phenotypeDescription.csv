314383000,Myocarditis,"Overview: Inflammatory disease of the myocardium (heart muscle) due to infectious or non infectious (autoimmune disease, drug hypersensitivity, toxins). Acute myocarditis is a condition with symptoms of heart failure developing over three months or less. Chronic myocarditis is myocarditis developing over greater than three months. Inflammatory cardiomyopathy is defined as myocarditis that is accompanied by cardiac dysfunction, and may lead to dilated cardiomyopathy or other cardiomyopathies. Presentation: Chest pain, fatigue, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, sudden death. Assessment: ECG, CBC (to evaluate for eosinophilic myocarditis), serum troponin, BNP or pro BNP, chest X ray, cardiac imaging (echocardiogram, angiogram, MRI). As last resort biopsy of the heart muscle. Plan: Treat underlying cause (antibiotics for bacterial infection, withdrawal of toxins) management of heart failure if present, critical care as appropriate, treatment of arrhythmias, anticoagulation if needed. Prognosis: Variable, from self-limited to death."
