4030518000,Renal impairment,"Overview: Renal impairment is decreased kidney function measured as decreased glomerular filtration rate (estimated eGFR using serum creatinine) that may be reversible or irreversible. Kidney damage refers to pathologic abnormalities, whether established via kidney biopsy or imaging studies, or inferred from markers such as urinary sediment abnormalities or increased rates of urinary albumin excretion. Acute Kidney Injury (formerly known as acute renal failure) is a type of organ failure (usually reversible) that is almost always because of pre-renal or renal (acute tubular necrosis) etiology, and is diagnosed by a criteria that is a combination of either increase in serum creatine (laboratory) or severe reduction in urine volume. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a heterogeneous group of common chronic disorders characterized by alterations in kidney structure and function, which a range of severity manifestation that depend on the underlying cause and rate & degree of loss of kidney function. CKD is defined by the presence of kidney damage or decreased kidney function for three or more months, irrespective of the cause, and this persistence of the damage or decreased function for at least three months is necessary to distinguish CKD from acute kidney disease. History of kidney transplantation even if normal kidney function is CKD. The term ""end-stage kidney disease"" (ESKD) generally refers to chronic kidney failure treated with either dialysis or transplantation. Presentation: Acute Kidney injury due to prerenal causes have symptoms of reduced urine output associated with decreased tissue perfusion insults (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoes, bleeding, sepsis that have lead to volume depletion, hypotension), while those due to renal causes such as exposure to nephrotoxins including drugs that may have blood and sediments in urine, with tachycardia and signs of uremia. Chronic Kidney Disease is usually asymptomatic in its early stages, as symptoms appear in later stages of disease or secondary to complications. In some cases patient may be diagnosed with CKD, when an asymptomatic CKD decompensates and manifests as acute (exacerbation of chronic) kidney disease. CKD disease is commonly recognized by hormonal and metabolic complications such as anemia and hyperparathyroidism, as the symptoms and signs are non-specific such as fatigue, hypertension, electrolyte imbalances, dyspnea and abnormal heart rhythm. Assessment: Establish if acute or chronic. If acute, look for life threatening situations like fluid overload - pulmonary edema, uremic syndrome, hyperkalemia, cardiac arrythmias, electrolytes, EKG.If CKD staging is performed using a combination of kidney damage (albuminuria) and function (GFR), and represent those with more severe disease and thus higher risk for progression and complications. Cause of CKD is essential part of assessment and is an indicator of prognosis. Assessment for kidney damage (albuminuria, urinary sediments, imaging changes, biopsy findings of glomerular, vascular or tubulointerstial disease, history of kidney transplantation even if normal kidney funciton is CKD). Kidney function - GFR is the best indicator and decling GFR is hallmark of progressive CKD. < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 is diagnostics, < 15 mL/min per 1.73 m2 or treatment by dialysis is kidney failure. CKD classification is based on etiology, GFR stages (6 sub categories G1 >= 90, G2 60 to 89, G3a 45 to 59, G3b 30 to 44, G4 15 to 29, G5 < 15), Albuminuria stages (A1 < 30, A2 30 to 300, A3 > 300). Plan: Is highly varied and depends on the stage and cause of disease. Many early stage may not need a specialist. CKD management is to reduce progression. Prognosis: depends on stage and cause, optimal management can slow down progression with good prognosis.","{
