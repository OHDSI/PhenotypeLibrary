439777000,Anemia,"Overview: Practically defined as low hemoglobin (<14g/dl M, <12g/dl F - but vary by age, race, special situations like atheletes, high altitude) and further characterized by red blood cell indices (MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW). Presentation: Signs and symptoms are variable, dependent upon degree of anemia and rate at which it evolved + oxygen demands. Can be asymptomatic. Fatigue, hypoxia. Assessment: Evaluate extent of anemia and find the cause (Fe, Vit B12 level, reticulocyte count, bilirubin) - decreased production (chemotherapy, bone marrow disease, nutrition vit b12, drug, alcohol - apalstic anemia, chronic kidney disease with low erythropoetin), increased destruction (most common is extravascular destruction in spleen or liver e.g. G6PD def, hemoglobinopathices like sickle cell, thalassemia, membrane defects like spherocytosis, or infections, hypersplenism, liver disease, OR, intravascular hemolysis - microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, paroxysmal noctural hemoglobinuria, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, snake bites, iv fluids, poisoning, transfusion reactions), increased loss (menstrual bleeding). Plan: Different causes and treatments. Prognosis: Very good Prognosis: and curable in many instances.
