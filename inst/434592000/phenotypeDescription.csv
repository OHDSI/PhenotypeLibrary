434592000,B-cell lymphoma,434592,"Overview: A type of cancer that forms in B cells (a type of immune system cell). Most B-cell lymphomas are non-Hodgkin lymphomas. There are many different types of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. These include Burkitt lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma. Presentation: One of the most common symptoms associated with lymphoma is the presence of swollen lymph nodes, also known as lymphadenopathy. The enlarged nodes do not cause pain but may be uncomfortable and felt beneath the skin, particularly in the neck and armpits. Other symptoms include night sweats or fevers, unexplained weight loss, or a lack of appetite. In more severe cases, patients experience difficulty breathing, pain and distention, and fatigue.Assessment: A biopsy is the only way to diagnose non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This involves taking a sample of cells using a small needle.Plan: The most common treatments to address B-cell lymphoma are radiation therapy, particularly in early stages and to respond to eventual complications; curative and palliative chemotherapy; and biologic therapy. However, the treatment is usually personalized to both the stage of the disease and the type of lymphoma.Prognosis: The overall five-year relative survival rate for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma is 70 percent. This varies a lot according to the type of B-cell lymphoma and stage at diagnosis. Some types of B-cell lymphomas can be cured. Treatment can slow progression in others.","",""
