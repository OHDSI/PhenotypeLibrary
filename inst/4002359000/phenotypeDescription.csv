4002359000,Monoclonal gammopathy,4002359,"Overview: The presence of an excess of a single type of antibody in the blood. Can be of ""uncertain significance"" (MGUS) or can represent a hematopoietic neoplasm ( multiple myeloma) or an autoimmune disorder. Presentation: Asymptomatic. Usually discovered incidentally when a complete metabolic panel shows an abnormal albumen to globulin ratio. Assessment: To further evaluate, check SPEP (serum protein electrophoresis), UPEP (urine), CBC with less than 10% monoclonal plasma cells on flow cytometry, normal function of kidneys, no lytic bone lesions on X ray, no anemia, no hypercalcemia, no hyperviscosity of the blood. rule out POEMS syndrome Plan: Asymptomatic , monitoring for development of symptmatic syndromes (multiple myeloma), for increase in percent of monoclonal plasma cells. Prognosis: IgG, IgA, or IgD MGUS most likely to become smoldering (asymptomatic) multiple myeloma to symptomatic MM. IgM MGUS can develop into smoldering Waldenstrom macroglobuminemia to symptomatic, or to lymphoma. IgM type can also become multiple myeloma. Prognosis: dependent on eventual development of symptomatic disease.","",""
