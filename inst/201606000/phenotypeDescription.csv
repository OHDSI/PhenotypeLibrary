201606000,Crohn's disease,"Overview: Is a disease with transmural inflammation anywhere in GI tract commonly with ulceration, by skip areas of involvement (ie, segments of normal-appearing bowel interrupted by areas of disease). The transmural inflammatory nature of Crohn disease may lead to fibrosis and strictures, leading to narrowing and obstructive clinical presentations. Also common are microperforation related symptoms because of sinus tracts and fistula formation. Crohn disease most commonly involves the ileum and proximal colon; however, any part of the gastrointestinal tract may be affected.Initial presentation: Common presentation are abdominal pain, diarrhea (with or without gross bleeding), fatigue, and weight loss. Assessment: Symptoms (eg, right lower quadrant abdominal pain, chronic intermittent diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss) and laboratory tests (eg, anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency, vitamin D deficiency). The diagnosis is established based results of colonoscopy with biopsy and histo pathologic examination that demonstrates segmental and transmural inflammation of the luminal gastrointestinal tract. Plan: Complex management that involves symptom management, diet management and drug therapy. Disease flares may occur, sometimes needing hospitalization. Prognosis: Life-long condition, with occasional remissions. It can progress to colon cancer."
