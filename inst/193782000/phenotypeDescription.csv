193782000,End-stage renal disease,193782,"Overview: End Stage Kidney Disease is stage 5 chronic kidney disease that has an estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <15 mL/min/1.73 m2) .Presentation: Early stages of chronic kidney disease may be asymptomatic, but as patients progress to ESKD signs/symptoms of uremia are common including volume overload, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, hypertension, anemia, and mineral and bone disorders.Assessment: Monitor kidney function, metabolic panel, daily weight to ensure no fluid overload, check for anemia and need for erythopoetin, check Creatinine if not on dialysis. Plan: Evaluate for cause of loss of kidney function. Monitor kidney size, when still functional, using Ultrasound. Once end stage kidney disease (ESKD) is established prep dialysis (catheter, fistula) and dialysis related management.Prognosis: Long term disease, benefits from kidney transplantation. Will usually need long term dialysis. Higher mortality.",,
