377091000,Seizure,"Overview: A seizure is a sudden change in behavior, movements or feelings, or levels of consciousness caused by electrical hypersynchronization of neuronal networks in the cerebral cortex. There are three subtypes : Acute symptomatic seizure refers to a seizure that occurs at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult; Unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure of unknown etiology as well as one that occurs in relation to a preexisting brain lesion or progressive nervous system disorder; Epilepsy (or epilepsy syndrome) - Two or more distinct unprovoked seizure > 24 hours apart, or a tendency to have recurrent seizures is epilepsy. Seizures are either focal or generalized (various types), or unknown onset. Most seizures can be categorized as either focal or generalized according to whether the onset of electrical activity involves a focal region of the brain or both sides of the brain simultaneously. Presentation: mild to severe, temporary confusion, staring spell, uncontrollable jerking movements of arms/legs, loss of awareness/consciousness, cognitive or emotional symptoms, such as fear, anxiety or deja vu. Assessment: is to determine if cause of seizure because of a systemic insult (i.e. potentially reversible e.g. metabolic derangements, drug or alcohol withdrawal) or an intrinsic dysfunction of the central nervous system (i.e. underlying brain pathology and long-term). The later is also commonly unprovoked seizures. Compared with children and young adults, older adults with a first seizure are more likely to have a cause of seizure identified by an initial evaluation and neuroimaging.. Review symptoms and hx of seizures; neuro exam, blood samples for infections, genetic conditions, blood sugar level and any electrolyte imbalances, lumbar puncture, EEG, CT, MRI, PET, Single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). Plan: anti-seizure medications (if more than one seizure); if meds do not work - surgery, vagus nerve stimulation, other types of neurostimulations. Prognosis: Can achieve good seizure control with medication. Impacts daily life, need personal safety.","{
