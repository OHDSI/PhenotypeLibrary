40481902000,Malignant neoplasm of anorectum,"Overview: Rectal cancer is cancer that begins in the rectum. Rectal neoplasms; Rectal tumor. Adenocarcinoma of the rectum. Presentation: Change in bowel habits, blood in stool, abdominal pain, weight loss, weakness or fatigue. Assessment: Screening for colorectal, colonoscopy, biopsy, Blood tests, Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), imaging (for spreading or not), pelvic MRI. Plan: Surgery (transanal local excision, removing all or part of the rectum), chemo, radiation, targeted drug therapy, and immunotherapy. Prognosis: Depends on staging. Early rectal cancers have extremely good prognosis. If they have not invaded through the muscle wall, the vast majority of them are cured by surgery. If the rectal cancer tumour has spread to other organs such as the liver or lung, the current 5 year survival is approximately 10%.","{
