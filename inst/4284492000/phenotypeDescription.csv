4284492000,Guttate psoriasis,4284492,"Overview: This is a sub-type of psoriasis with presentation different from plaque psoriasis. Most patients with new onset of guttate psoriasis have no previous history of psoriasis. Presentation: Guttate psoriasis is characterized by the abrupt (acute) appearance of multiple small, psoriatic papules and plaques, commonly in a child or young adult with no previous history of psoriasis. It occurs less commonly among patients with pre-existing psoriasis. The papules and plaques are usually less than 1 cm in diameter (giving rise to the name ""guttate,"" which means ""drop-like""). The trunk and proximal extremities are the primary sites of involvements. There is a strong association between recent infection (usually streptococcal pharyngitis) and guttate psoriasis.Assessment: Diagnosis is by clinical examination. A skin biopsy is occasionally used.Plan: Overlaps with chronic plaque psoriasis such as phototherapy and topical agents. Prognosis: May spontaneously remit, over course of weeks or months. Disease may progress to chronic plaque psoriasis. Disease remission is the most common course.","",""
