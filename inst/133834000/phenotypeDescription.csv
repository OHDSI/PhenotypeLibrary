133834000,Atopic dermatitis,"Overview: Atopic dermatitis is part of a spectrum of hypersensitivity/allergic conditions. Presentation: It is characterized by dry, severely itchy/pruritic skin – but presentation is highly variable. Acute onset may be intensely pruritic erythematous papules and vesicles with exudation and crusting. Sub-acute or chronic states may have a long-standing history of dry, scaly or excoriated erythematous papules with skin thickening from chronic scratching (lichenification) and fissuring. Assessment: Diagnosis is based on clinical judgment and performed by elimination of triggers that might reduce symptoms. Plan: Identify trigger, symptom management, and steroids as needed. Prognosis: resolves with elimination of trigger."
