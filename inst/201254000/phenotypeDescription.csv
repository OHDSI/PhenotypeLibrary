201254000,Type 1 diabetes mellitus,"Overview: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), is one of the most common chronic diseases in childhood and is caused by insulin deficiency following (auto-antibody mediated) destruction of the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. Type 1 accounts for about 80% of Diabetes Mellitus in childhood and about 25% of adults. Its incidence varies by geography, age, gender, family history and ethnicity - and is associated with both genetic and environmental risk factors. A chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin to control blood sugar levels. T1 was previously called insulin-dependent diabetes or juvenile diabetes.  T1a (85% - have detectable autoantibodies for pancreatic beta cells), T1b (no detectable autoantibodies, for pancreatic beta cells). Presentation: Hyperglycemia without acidosis is the most common presentation of childhood T1DM in most populations - with polyuria, polydipsia and weight loss detected in ambulatory settings. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA, hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis) is second most common presentation - but severe symptoms compared to those without acidosis. Bed-wetting in kids who previously did not wet the bed. Some may be silent. Assessment: First step establish DM diagnosis using any one of glycated hemoglobin (A1C) >= 6.5, fasting plasma glucose >= 126, random venous plasma glucose >= 200, oral gluocse tt >= 200. ). There is no set of criteria or diagnostic test can consistently distinguish between T1 and T2 - but may be based on a combination of body habitus (T2 - obese), age (T1- younger), insulin resistance (T2 - acanthosis nigricans), Antibodies (T1 - pancreatic islet-specific pancreatic autoantibodies), high fasting insulin (in T2) and C-peptides (in T2). Plan: diabetes education, blood sugar monitoring, insulin therapy, diet, and exercise. Age based care - challenging with young children. Prognosis: Careful management leads to risk reduction."
