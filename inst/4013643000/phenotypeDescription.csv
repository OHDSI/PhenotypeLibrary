4013643000,Pulmonary arterial hypertension,"Overview: PAH is one of the five subtypes of Pulmonary hypertension. The diagnosis requires exclusion of other subtypes of PH such as those due to left heart disease, chronic lung disease involving hypoxemia, ventous themobembolic pulmonary artery obstruction and miscelaneous causes of PH. Idiopathic and heritable PAH are clinically indistinguishable but genetic tests may help distinguish the two. The following conditions are assosicated with PAH - connective tissue disorders (systemic sclerosis/scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erytematous, raynaud disease, mixed connective tissue disease). Also associated with HIV, Portal hypertension, congential heart disease with shunts, schistosomiasis. Presentation: often a manifestation of underlying etiology, the presentations are progressive exertional dyspnea and fatigure. Assessment: Non invasive (EKG, Echocardiogram) to invasive hemodynamic test (right heart catheterization) to establish diagnosis and find etiology. Plan: Treat underlying cause where possible. Improve breathing. O2 therapy, anticoagulants, calcium channel blockers, prostaglandins, possible for a lung transplant or septostomy. Heritable PAH is confirmed if two or more family members have PAH or if a BMPR2 gene mutation or mutation in another gene known to cause PAH is identified in the affected person. Prognosis: Chronic, can last for years or be lifelong. Life-threatening condition that gets worse over time, but treatments can help the symptoms.","{
