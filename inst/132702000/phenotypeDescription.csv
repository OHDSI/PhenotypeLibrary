132702000,Erythema multiforme,"Overview: Erythema multiformae (EM) is an acute, immune mediated manifestation characterized by distinctive circular target shaped skin lesions - often accompanied by erosions or bullates involving the oral, genital and/or occular mucosae. EM major is used to describe severe mucosal involvement, EM minor refers to EM without mucosal involvement. Most commonly induced by infection, commonly herpes simplex, mycoplasma pneumoniae. Can also be precipitated by drugs (NSAIDs, sulfonamides, antiepileptics, and antibiotics). EM major is considered to be distinct disease from Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) (usually a drug-induced disorder that may present with cutaneous, targetoid lesions and mucosal erosions. Atypical target lesions of SJS tend to be macular, rather than the papular lesions associated with EM). Presentation: Either after an infection or an offending drug development of multiple, sometimes spreading rashes. Assessment: Skin biopsy with staining to rule out autoimmune disease and other causes (rule out cuaneous small vessel vasculitis, bullous pemphigoid, fixed drug eruption, urticaria). Plan: If not autoimmune disease, topical steroids. If severe, systemic treatment with mycophenolate, thalidomide, immunoglobulins. Systemic corticosteroids are also used. Prognosis: self-limited, resolving within weeks without significant sequale. A subset of patients may develop recurrent EM over many years with substantial morbidity.","{
