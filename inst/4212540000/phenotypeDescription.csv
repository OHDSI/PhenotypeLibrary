4212540000,Chronic liver disease,"Overview: Chronic Liver Disease (CLD) is a hetergenous group of long standing liver diseases with similar presentation, all characterized by progressive destruction of liver function (clotting factors, albumin, metabolism and excretion of bile) over many months (?6 months) - common to all CLD is continuous process of inflammation, destruction and regeneration of liver parenchyma leading to fibrosis and cirrhosis. The etiology for CLD is broad to include alcoholic liver disease (including alcoholic fatty liver, alcohol hepatitis), non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD NASH), Chronic Viral Hepatitis (B, C, D), genetic (alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency esp children, hereditary hemochromatosis - excessive iron abosrption, wilsons disease - copper accumulation), automimmune causes (primary biliar cirrhosis PBC, primary sclerosing cholangitis PSC, autoimmune hepatitis AIH), long term drug exposure (amiodarone, isoniazid, methotrexate, phenytoin, nitrofurantoin), Vascular (Budd chiari syndrome). It may also be due to idiopathic or cryptogenic reasons. Presentation: highly variable and depends on the degree of destruction of liver function - but most commonly asymptomatic and detected incidentally or during screening (e.g. hepatitis). Hepatitis may occassionally be associated non specific right upper quadrant pain or discomfort. Most commonly patients are found to have mild elevated liver enzymes on screening test, that when further evaluated leads to etiologic diagnosis. Decompesation (e.g. chronic liver failure) is associated with portal hypertension (variceal bleeding, hematemesis, melena), thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, jaundice - ascities with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatitic encephalopathy (lactulose/rifampin). Primary sclerosing cholangitis has cholestatic pattern (elevated serum alkaline phosphatase, abrnomal bile ducts thickening, dilataion, strictures). Assessment: livery biopsy is considered gold standard to measure fibrosis and cirrhosis, but is now increasingly being replaced by non invasive methods (elastrography). Screen for viral hepatitis. Liver ultrasound. Plan: find the etiology and treat the cause where possible. e.g. antiviral, hep C - 3 months negative = cure. Cirrhosis - prevent decompensation. Autoimmune - induce remission (steroids, azathioprine). Decompensated cirrhosis - liver transplantation."
