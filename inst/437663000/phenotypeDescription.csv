437663000,Fever,"Overview: Body temperature is regulated by hypothalamus with normal range between 36.5 to 37.5C with rectal temperature slightly higher. Fever is elevation of body temperature above normal variations with temperature above 38.3C accepted to high enough is most cases. It is caused due to change in hypothalamic set point. Hyperthermia may occur without change in hypothalamic set point - so not all hyperthermia is fever e.g. heat stroke is not fever. Presenation: May be accompanied by chills, rigors/shivering because of increased heat production from muscles. Assessment: exclude hyperthermia. Check for infections, toxins. Plan: treat the cause. Symptoms may be managed with antipyretics. Prognosis: most are short lived, with identifiable or suspected etiology. Rarely may be fever of unknown origin."
