Macular degeneration (wears down) causes loss in the center of the field of vision. Another form of macular degeneration, called Stargardt disease or juvenile macular degeneration, affects children and young adults. Presentation: Blurred vision is most common. Visual: partial loss of vision, abnormality where straight lines appear wavy, blurred vision, distorted vision, inability to see in dim light, or seeing spots, and new and abnormal blood vesselsAssessment: Routine eye exam, Amsler grid eye test, angiography (specifically OCT - looking at blood vessels in the retina)Plan: Combination of vitamins and minerals (AREDS formula) may reduce disease progression. Surgery may also be an option. Prognosis: Chronic: can last for years or be lifelong. There is no cure, treatment slows the disease and can prevent severe loss of vision."
