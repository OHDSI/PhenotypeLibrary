4138837000,Pericarditis,"Overview: Inflammation of the pericardial fibroelastic sac - classified into five subtypes, Acute and recurrent pericarditis, Pericardial effusion without major hemodynamic compromise, Cardiac tamponade with hemodynamic compromise, Constrictive pericarditis, Effusive-constrictive pericarditis. If myocardial inflammation is also present  then the term myopericarditis or perimyocarditis is used. Presentation: Sharp chest pain improved by sitting up and leaning forward. If pericardiatis is due to infection, fever may be present. Assessment: Auscultation for pericardial friction rub; ECG showing widespread ST elevations, chest x ray, cardiac markers (troponin) elevation, pericardiocentesis/pericardial biopsy, CBC, sed rate, CRP, echocardiography. Blood cultures for fever, rheumatology workup in young women. Plan: NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) with colchicine or aspirin. If this treatment fails, further workup needed to rule out atypical forms of pericarditis including tuberculosis, cancer, and inflammatory disease. Most low risk patients may be managed in ambulatory settings, high risk patients need to be hospitalized. High risk features include fever, sub-acute onset, hemodynamic compromise/cardiac tamponade, immunosuppression, on anticoagulant therapy, acute trauma, elevated cardiac enzymes. Prognosis: Patients with acute idiopathic or viral pericarditis have a good long-term prognosis - typically self-limited over 2 weeks with NSAID treatment resulting in good long-term prognosis. Cardiac tamponade rarely occurs in patients with acute idiopathic pericarditis and is more common in patients with a specific underlying etiology such as malignancy, tuberculosis, or purulent pericarditis. Constrictive pericarditis may occur in approximately 1 percent of patients with acute idiopathic pericarditis and is also more common in patients with a specific etiology."
