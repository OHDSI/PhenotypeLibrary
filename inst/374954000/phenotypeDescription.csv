374954000,Optic neuritis,374954,"Overview: Part of the spectrum of Acute Disseminated encephalomyelitis, specifically Multiple Sclerosis. Caused by inflammation which demyelinates (removes the insulation from the axon of the optic nerve, slowing the transmission of nerve signals) the nerves involved in vision causing acute monocular (one eye) vision loss. Presentation: unilateral (rarely bilateral) vision loss peaking in hours to 2 weeks. Eye pain usually present. Assessment: Abnormal pupillary reflexes, visual field deficits, swelling of optic disc on physical exam, but exam of the retina can be normal as well. Some patients report ""flashers"". Color vision is disturbed. Lumbar puncture, auto-antibody testing, and ophthalmology consult strongly recommended. In older patients (>50 YO) rule out giant cell arteritis, diabetes) MRI brain; evaluate for infection. Plan: Withdraw offending agent, serial eye exams, treatment of underlying infection, steroids, immune modulators (IVIG), treatment of MS if diagnosis is present. Prognosis: Most patients recover functional vision within one year. Prognosis: for patients ultimately diagnosed with MS tends to be worse.",,
