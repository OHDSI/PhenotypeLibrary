198985000,Renal cancer,"Overview: Kidney cancer. In adults, renal cell carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer. Young children are more likely to develop a kind of kidney cancer called Wilms' tumor. Presentation: Symptoms present over time: blood in urine, back pain, loss of appetite, weight loss, fatigue and fever. Symptoms depend too on where the cancer spreads. Assessment: Blood and urine tests, imaging, kidney biopsy; grading and staging Plan: Surgery (nephrectomy), cryoablation, radiofrequency ablation, immunotherapy, radiation, chemotherapyPrognosis: When detected early, kidney cancer is curable most of the time. Even in more advanced stages, new therapies and procedures have led to much improved, overall cure rates.","{
