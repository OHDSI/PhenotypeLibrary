437222000,Respiratory syncytial virus infection,437222,"Overview: RSV, is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. Most people recover in a week or two, but RSV can be serious, especially for infants and older adults. Severe RSV disease is #1 reason infants under 1 year of age are hospitalized in the USPresentation: Runny nose, decrease in appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever, and wheezing. Show symptoms within 4 to 6 days after getting infected.Assessment: Mild RSV symptoms are similar to the common cold, testing usually isn't required for diagnosis. However, there are some lab tests to confirm diagnosis, the most common is a mouth swab or a blood test to check white blood cell counts and look for viruses. In severe RSV cases that require hospitalization, additional testing may be needed. Imaging tests, such as a chest X-ray or CT scan can check for lung complications. Blood and urine cultures may be necessary when infants are very sick, as RSV-related bronchiolitis can occur with a urinary tract infection in newborns.Plan: No specific treatment for RSV infection, though researchers are working to develop vaccines and antivirals. Manage fever and pain with OTC fever reducers and pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. There are currently only two drugs approved - Palivizumab is a monoclonal antibody for the prevention of RSV in high-risk children and ribavirin is approved for treatment of severe RSV disease.Prognosis: Most RSV infections go away on their own in a week or two. But some people with RSV infection, especially infants younger than 6 months of age and older adults, may need to be hospitalized if they are having trouble breathing or are dehydrated. In most of these cases, hospitalization only lasts a few days.",,
