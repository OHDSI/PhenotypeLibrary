4256228000,Respiratory failure,"Overview: Respiratory failure is one of the most common reasons for ICU admission and is classified mechanistically into Type 1-4 respiratory failure. Type 1 (alveloar flooding e.g. pulmonary edema - occurring in sepsis, pneumonitis due to aspiration/chemical, pneumonia, near drowning, etc - hypoxemic Pao2 < 60), Type 2 (due to alveolar hypoventillation and CO2 retention - CNS depression, respiratory muscle weakness. Muscle failure may occur due to bronchoconstriction, atelectasis or pneumothorax type of insults - hypercapnic, Paco2 > 45, often with hypoxemia), Type 3 (atelectasis including perioperative atelectasis), Type 4 (hypoperfusion of respiratory muscles). Presentation: Maybe acute, chronic or acute on chronic. S/S of ARDS. Assessment: Physical exam, pulse oximetry, arterial blood gas (ABG), and chest xray, bronchoscopy. Plan: Supprotive therapy O2 including breathing treatment, NIV or IV intuabation/tracheostomy + treat the inciting cause + monitor. Prognosis: long-term, ischemic injury related sequela. Mechanical ventillation may cause barotrauma.","{
