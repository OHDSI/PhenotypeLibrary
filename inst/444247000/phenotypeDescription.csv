444247000,Venous thromboembolism,"Overview: Condition in which a blood clot forms most often in the deep veins of the leg, groin or arm (known as deep vein thrombosis, DVT) and travels in the circulation, lodging in the lungs (known as pulmonary embolism, PE). A PE is more serious than a DVT. Presentation: DVTs (in the arm or legs) can cause pain, swelling, redness, and warmth near the blocked vein. PE can present as hard to breathe and tachycardia, chest pain, and dizzinessAssessment: D-dimer (blood test), duplex ultrasound (leg or arm), for PE - pulse oximetry, arterial blood gas, CXR, CT, and Ventilation perfusion (V/Q) scan, Pulmonary angiogramPlan: Anticoagulants, thrombin inhibitors, clot-busting meds (thrombolytics) like tPA (tissue plasminogen activator), sometimes surgery (filter into a vein)Prognosis: Dangerous but treatable. The risk of developing VTE is highest after major surgery or a major injury, or when you have heart failure, cancer, or a heart attack.","{
