4322024000,Pulmonary hypertension,"Overview: Is of five major subtypes based on etiology. (PAH, PH due to left heart disease, PH due to lung disease and/or hypoxia, PH due to pulmonary artery obstructions such as thromboembolism, PH with unclear or multifactorial reasons) with PAH being Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (inhertiable, connective tissue or drug indcued). A type of high blood pressure that affects arteries in the lungs and in the heart. Also known as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Presentation: Non specific with progressive exertional dyspnea and fatigue often associated with symptoms of causative etiology. Assessment: initial differential diagnosis is wide and diagnosis requires multliple testing and search for etiology. Echocardiography, and cardiac catheterization are essential but diagnosis may be made clinically without invasive hemodynamic testing. Diagnosis: A mean pulmonary artery pressure at rest of > 20 mm Hg is diagnostic. Plan: Medication and oxygen therapy, life style changes. Anticoagulation, gigoxin, and vasodilators. Surgery - ballon atrial septostomy, balloon pulmonary angioplasty, or pulmonary endarterectomy. Prognosis: Condition worsens over time and can lead to heart failure. No cure. Goal is to slow down the progression of the disease."
