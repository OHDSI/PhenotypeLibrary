192359000,Renal failure syndrome,"Overview:  [depcreated in favor of 4030518000, Renal Impairment] Action myoclonus–renal failure syndrome. Causes episodes of involuntary muscle jerking or twitching (myoclonus) and, often, kidney (renal) disease. A rare form of progressive myoclonus epilepsy associated with severe renal dysfunction. AMRF syndrome is caused by mutations in the SCARB2 gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Presentation: Neurologic symptoms - involuntary rhythmic shaking (tremor) in the fingers and hands; over time, tremors can affect other parts of the body, such as the head, torso, legs, and tongue. Eventually, the tremors worsen to become myoclonic jerks, and precede to renal manisfestations (proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome and end-stage renal disease. Assessment: Genetic testing, EEG, renal functionPlan: Treatment of neurologic manifestations, antiepileptic drugs, genetic counseling, treatment of renal manifestations (dialysis, transplant). Prognosis: Lifelong follow including regular monitoring of antiepileptic drug treatment and renal function. Disease manifestations are usually evident in the late teens or early twenties."
