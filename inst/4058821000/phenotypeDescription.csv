4058821000,Primary sclerosing cholangitis,4058821,"Overview: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic progressive disorder of unknown etiology that is characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, and stricturing of medium and large ducts in the intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic biliary tree. Presentation: PSC may be asymptomatic and diagnosed as part of the evaluation of abnormal laboratory tests, or they may have symptoms such as fatigue and pruritus. Assessment: Physical examination may reveal jaundice, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and excoriations, though it is often normal. Liver biochemical tests usually demonstrate a cholestatic pattern, with elevation of the serum alkaline phosphatase predominating in most patients. Radiographic findings include abnormal-appearing bile ducts with wall thickening, dilations, and strictures. Liver biochemical tests usually demonstrate a cholestatic pattern, with elevation of the serum alkaline phosphatase predominating in most patients. The serum alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin may fluctuate substantially, possibly indicating transient blockage of strictured bile ducts by biliary sludge or small stones. The serum aminotransferases are typically less than 300 international unit/L. The serum albumin concentration is normal in patients with early stage disease, although those with active inflammatory bowel disease may have hypoalbuminemia. Plan: A variety of immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory agents have been studied in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)These include: Ursodeoxycholic acid, Glucocorticoids, CyclosporinePrognosis: The disease ultimately leads to complications of cholestasis and hepatic failure","",""
