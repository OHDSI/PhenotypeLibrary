432893000,Myasthenic syndrome,432893,"Overview: Also known as Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. A disease of reduced acetylcholine release from nerve terminals at the nerve-muscle interface. Thought to be autoimmune. Presentation: Patient develops slowly progressive proximal (shoulders, thighs) muscle weakness. Assessment: Physical exam including neuromuscular exam, EMG. Deep tendon reflexes can be briefly recovered by vigorous exercise (postexercse activation). Motor and sensory nerve conduction studies needed. needle EMG. serology testing for autoantibodies. Evaluate for malignancy if indicated (CT chest, abdomen pelvis and MRI brain and spinal cord). Plan: If malignancy is present, treat malignacy. Mild weakness does not require treatment. Moderate to severe weakness medication used is amifampridine. Alternative medications available but have less favorable adverse reaction profiles. IVIG, prednisone, or other immune suppressive agents if amifampridine fails. Prognosis: If due to cancer (paraneoplastic) survival is poor. If not due to cancer (nonparaneoplastic) good prognosis.",,
