201965000,Shock,"Overview: Four types of non mutually exclusion shocks are recognized: distributive (septic, non septic - anaphylatic, neurogenic, SIRS), cardiogenic (cardiomyopathic - MI, arrythomogenic, mechanical), hypovolemic (hemorrhagic, non-hemorrhagic - diarrhoea, vomiting), and obstructive (pulmonary embolism, tension pneumothorax, pericardial tamponade, constrictive pericarditis). Cardiogenic shock is a subtype of shock phenotype where there is inability of the heart to pump an adequate amount of blood leading to decreased oxygen and nutrient delivery to the tissues and, if tissue perfusion reduction is prolonged, potentially end-organ damage and multi-system failure. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) with left ventricular failure is the most common cause of cardiogenic shock. Cardiogenic shock is the leading cause of death in patients with acute MI. Cardiogenic shock has persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure <80 to 90 mmHg or mean arterial pressure 30 mmHg lower than baseline) with severe reduction in the cardiac index (<1.8 L/min per m2 without support or <2 to 2.2 L/min per m2 with support) with adequate filling pressures. Other causes of cardiogenic shock include acute mitral valve regurgitation, rupture of ventricular septal or free walls, cardiac tamponade. Septic shock is a subtype of shock phenotype with distributive type of shock. SIRS is a clinical syndrome that is characterized by a robust inflammatory response to infectious (or non infectious) insult. Sepsis, defined as a dysregulated host response to infection resulting in life-threatening organ dysfunction. There is a continuum of severity ranging from sepsis to septic shock. Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome is a type of sepsis and a type of septic shock. Presentation: The cardinal features of shock, irrespective of shock type, include clinical manifestations of hypoperfusion such as hypotension (which occurs in most patients), oliguria, abnormal mental status, cold clammy skin, and evidence of metabolic acidosis on laboratory testing. The ""classic"" patient with cardiogenic shock has severe systemic hypotension, signs of systemic hypoperfusion (eg, cool extremities, oliguria, and/or alteration in mental status), and respiratory distress due to pulmonary congestion. Shock is a physiologic continumm that begins with inciting event that triggers physiological changes. Pre-shock/compensated shock is characterized by compensatory responses to diminished tissue perfusion - tachycardia, peripheral vasoconstriction, elevated systemic blood pressure. Shock - compensatory mechanisms are overwhelmed, organ dysfunction may start with dyspnea, restlessnes, diaphoresis, metabolic acidosis, hypotension. End-organ dysfunction including anuria, acute renal failure, acidemia, comma, death. Cardiogenic shock presentation is similar to other forms of shock (see shock phenotype) along with evidence of myocardial insult to explain the shock such as MI. Most patients who develop cardiogenic shock due to acute MI do so after hospital admission for MI because of eventual failure of intial compensatory mechanisms that protected the individual from hemodynamic failure with about 50% developing within 24 hours of infarct. Sepsis shock may be expected to have sepsis symptoms such as fever, tachycardia, elevated respiratory rate, abnormal white blood count, and severely ill looking.  Assessment: find the cause, evaluate for septic or cardiogenic or other causes. Diagnosis of cardiogenic shock requires strong clinical judgment by looking for some combination of difficulty breathing, hypotension, hypoperfusion, pulmonary congestion - supported by ECG abnormalality, chest x ray with pulmonary congestion, and wall motion abnormality on echocardiogram. To identify infection in suspected sepsis - blood/urine/sputum cultures, wound cultures if a wound present, lumbar puncture if indicated clinically,lactate level. Plan: Treat as emergency. ICU admission, hemodynamic monitoring with pulmonary artery catheterization if needed, vasopressor drugs (norepinephrine, dopamine), supplemental oxygen/ventilatory support, pH managment of lactic acidosis. Treat the cause. Cardiogenic shock- diagnostic coronary angiography, attempt reperfusion of heart if MI, coronary artery revascularization. fluid replenishment, hemodynamic monitoring and management, airway management and ventillation. For sepsis - may need to start with broad spectrum antibiotics after cultures are drawn (even when pending), and then narrow antibiotics based on results of susceptibility testing. Prognosis: highly variable. Cardiogenic shock - early revascularization has better prognosis."
