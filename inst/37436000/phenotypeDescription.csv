37436000,Disorder of optic nerve,"Overview: optic nerve connects retinal ganglion cells to visual nuclei, and is considered an extension of CNS and not a peripheral nerve with four segments (intraocular/optic disc, intraorbial, optic foramen, intracranial part. Presentation: optic nerve lesions produce monocular visual loss usually associated with afferent pupillary defect, central vision loss (scotoma), dyschromatopsia, papillitis/optic neuritis, optic atrophy. Optic neuritis ON (in young) and ischemic optic neuropathy ION (older, > 50) are two most common optic nerve disease. Anterior ION (optic disc) & Posterior ION (retrobulbar). Nonarteritic ION is the most common ION, and can be AION or PION. AION is common with giant cell arteritis and > 70 yr. Optic neuritis is an inflammatory, demyelinating condition that is highly associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), some ON are associated with infections - west nile, cat scratch, toxoplasmosis or may be a complication of meningitis, or vasculitis. Postviral optic neuritis has been associated with measles, mumps, chickenpox, influenza, and Epstein-Barr virus, typically follow clinical infection by 1 to 3 weeks - more common in children and often bilateral. Bilateral ON may occur in GB syndrome. Sarcoidosis may be associated with ON - often bilateral. Chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy (CRION)is rare, relapsing autoimmune optic neuritis without know causes like sarcoidosis, lupus, MS, etc. Compressive optic neuropathies are slowly progressing vision loss due to compression from neoplasia or other mass in region. ON may be genetic - Leber and Kjer's. Drugs and toxins may cause ON - e.g ethambutol, and potentially infliximab, sildenafil, amiodarone. Presentation: maybe acute, sub-acute or chronic and is different based on etiology. NION is commonly acute, monoocular, painless visual loss with optic disc swelling. ON is acute, painful, monocular visual loss in younger (18 to 40 y) - that evolves over several days. Assessment: opthalmologic exam and MRI is usually essential. Gadolinimum MRI shows lesion in 90% of ON, but does not show in ION. Plan: no effective treatment for ION. ON may be management with methylprednisolone. Prognosis: IONs have poor prognosis compared to ON.","{
