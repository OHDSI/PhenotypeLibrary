432870000,Thrombocytopenic disorder,"Overview: low platelet count = Thrombocytopenia. Fewer than 150,000 platelets per microliter. Platelets stop bleeding by clumping and forming plugs in blood vessel injuries. Presentation: Thrombocytopenia is associated with varying  risks of bleeding, thrombosis, and other potential complications - but are most often asymptomatic. Risks are dependent on absolute platelet count and underlying disease that lead to thrombocytopenia. Excessive bruising (purpura), prolonged bleeding from cuts, gum or nose bleeding, blood in urine or stools. Assessment: There is no 'safe' platelet count and range of normal is broad. CBC, including platelets, physical exam for spleen enlargement. Plan: Depends on cause and severity. Blood or platelet transfusions, corticosteroids, surgery (remove spleen, splenectomy). Prognosis: Treated early and effectively - leads to better outcomes."
