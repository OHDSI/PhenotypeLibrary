378253000,Headache,378253,"Overview: one of the most common medical condition, but in about 90% of cases it is either migraine, tension-type (most common), and cluster headache. The generic term headache would be used to describe these three sub-types of headache.Presentation: Migraine is recurrent attacks, often unilateral, throbbing/pulsatile quality often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia. Tension-type headache - bilateteral, nonthrobbing headache without other associated features. Cluster headache - severe unilateral headaches accompanied by autonmic phenomena like congestion, edema, sweating, miosis. Secondary headaches are special cases of headache due to underlying cause such as systemic disorder (acute hypertension, meningitis) or neurological (increased intracranial pressure). The common use of term headache, should not include secondary headache.Assessment: rule out serious underlying pathology and secondary causes such as meningitis, trauma, etc. all may suggest need for CT scan of head. Look for red-flags. Photophobia, Incapcitiy and Nausea are screening for migraine. Plan: Acute or headaches because of secondary causes should involve management of underlying etiology (not part of this phenotype). Migraine headache management is to reduce frequency of symptoms/attacks. Simple analgesics NSAIDS. Triptans, muscle relaxants, antihistamine (cocktail)Prognosis: varible - may go into remission",NA,NA
