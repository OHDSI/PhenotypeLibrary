381591000,Cerebrovascular disease,"Overview: Cerebrovascular disease (subsumes cerebrovascular accident) are a group of conditions that affect the cerebral vasculature and blood flow, resulting in or predisposing to cerebrovascular accident/stroke (includes vascular anomalies - both congenital and acquired , av malformations, capillary telangiectasia etc). A stroke (cerebrovascular accident) is a highly variable clinical condition (clinical diagnosis supported by testing) defined as abrupt onset of a neurologic deficit that is attributatble to a focal vascular cause (i.e. cerebrovascular disease). Cerebral ischemia is caused by reduction in blood flow to brain tissue for more than a few seconds - because neurons lack glycogen, energy failure rapidly ensures and neurologic symptoms manifest in seconds. If cessation of blood flow lasts for more than a few minutes - cerebral infarction (brain tissue death) may occur. If blood supply is restored before infarction, full recovery is possible - transient ischemic attack (TIA). TIA is defined as all neurologic signs and symptoms resolved within 24hr without evidence of brain infarction on brain imaging (most < 1hr). Stroke is said to have occurrred if the neurologic signs and symptoms persist for > 24hr or brain infarction is seen on imaging. A generalized reduction in cerebral blood flow (e.g. systemic hypotension due to arrythmia, myocardial infarction) usually produces syncope, and if long enough may lead to globa hypoxia-ischemia encephalopathy - this is not stroke because it is not focal vascular disease. Stroke syndrome may occur because of focal ischemia/infarction (obstruction of vessel) or intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding into or around brain with ischemic neurologic symptoms secondary to mass effect, increased intracranial pressure or toxins). Seizure, intracrainal tumor, migraine, metabolic encephalopathy may mimic stroke - but is not stroke. Stroke syndromes are divided (based on vasculature) into - large-vessel stroke within anterior circulation (internal carotid artery and branches - middle cerebral artery, anterior cerebral artery, anterior choroidal artery, internal carotid artery, common carotid artery), large-vessel stroke within posterior circulation (basillar artery, vertebral artery, internal cerebellar artery), small-vesssel disease(old name lacunar stroke) of either vascular bed. Ischemic penumbra - tissue around core area of infarction with reversible ischemia. Thrombotic (ischemic) strokes are those in which the pathologic process giving rise to thrombus formation in an artery produces a stroke either by reduced blood flow distally (low flow) or by an embolic fragment that breaks off and travels to a more distant vessel (artery-to-artery embolism). Embolic strokes are divided into four categories (known cardiac source, possible cardiac or aortic source, arterial source, unknown source). Hemorrhagic stroke are classifed based on location - intracranial hemorrhage (ICH - parenchymal hemorrhage), subdural and epidural hemorrhage (later two mostly due to trauma induced vessel damage). Intracranial hemorrhage is divided into hypertensive ICH (commonly spontaneous rupture of small artery) or large lobar hemorrhage (e.g. temporal hemorrhage). Presentation: Highly variable. stroke - facial droop, arm weakness, speech difficulty. headache, vertigo, N/V, confusion, arm/leg/face numbness, difficult to walk. Small vessel ischemic stroke usually present as pure motor hemoiparesis, pure sensory stroke, ataxic hemiparesis, dyarthria and clumsy limbs. Hemorrhagic stroke is more commonly associated with headache, ischemic stroke is more commonly with seizures. Assessment: the goal is to establish clinical diagnosis and evaluate if hemorrhage or ischemia, so that treatment plan may be initiated. CT head is highly sensitive for hemorrhagic stroke. Initial management does not depend on etiology - establishin etiology helps prevent recurrence. TOAST classification (5 subtypes) is commonly used to establish etiology of ischemic stroke. Histpry & physical, angiogram, ultrasound, CT, EEG, lumbar puncture, MRI. Review history of anticoagulation and need for reversal. Plan: ABC resusciation first. Goal is to prevent or reverse brain injury. Medical support (BP management), IV thrombolysis, endovascular revascularization, antithrombotic therapy (aspirin), neuroprotection, stroke center referal and rehabilitation. Prognosis: can highly impacted by management especially acute management of stroke. After acute management, risk of recurrence needs to be reduced and any long-term sequela addressed through rehabilitation.","{
