46271022000,Chronic kidney disease,"Overview: [depcreated in favor of 4030518000, Renal Impairment] Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a heterogeneous group of common disorders characterized by alterations in kidney structure and function, which a range of severity manifestation that depend on the underlying cause . describes the gradual loss of kidney function with care strategies that range from prevention, early detection, to advanced management like transplant and dialysis. The term ""end-stage kidney disease"" (ESKD) generally refers to chronic kidney failure treated with either dialysis or transplantation. CKD is defined by the presence of kidney damage or decreased kidney function for three or more months, irrespective of the cause. This persistence of the damage or decreased function for at least three months is necessary to distinguish CKD from acute kidney disease. Kidney damage refers to pathologic abnormalities, whether established via kidney biopsy or imaging studies, or inferred from markers such as urinary sediment abnormalities or increased rates of urinary albumin excretion. Decreased kidney function refers to a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is usually estimated (eGFR) using serum creatinine and one of several available equations. History of kidney transplantation even if normal kidney funciton is CKD. Presentation: CKD is usually asymptomatic in its early stages, as symptoms appear in later stages of disease or secondary to complications. The disease is commonly recognized by hormonal and metabolic complications such as anemia and hyperparathyroidism. Symptoms and signs are commonly slowly evolving non-specific features such as fatigue, hypertension, electrolyte imbalances, dyspnea and abnormal heart rhythm. Assessment: For kidney damage (albuminuria, urinary sediments, imaging changes, biopsy findings of glomerular, vascular or tubulointerstial disease, history of kidney transplantation even if normal kidney funciton is CKD). Kidney function - GFR is the best indicator and decling GFR is hallmark of progressive CKD. < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 is diagnostics, < 15 mL/min per 1.73 m2 or treatment by dialysis is kidney failure. Evidence of chronicity (with repeat testing) is essential to establish chronicity and rule out acute kidney disease. CKD staging is performed using a combination of kidney damage (albuminuria) and function (GFR), and represent those with more severe disease and thus higher risk for progression and complications. Cause of CKD is essential part of assessment and is an indicator of prognosis. Plan: Is highly varied and depends on the stage and cause of disease. Many early stage may not need a specialist. Prognosis: depends on stage and cause, optimal management can slow down progression with good prognosis."
