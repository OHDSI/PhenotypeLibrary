Presentation: skin rashes and blistering, itchy patches, irritated blistersAssessment: Blisters are present, skin biopsy, blood tests (antibodies), thyroid testing (rule-out other diseases)Plan: Steroids, skin emollients, anti-inflammotory drugs, antibiotics for infection, immunosuppressantsPrognosis: Weeks to years of treatment before the symptoms resolve entirely.
