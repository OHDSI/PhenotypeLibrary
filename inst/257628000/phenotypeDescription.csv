257628000,Systemic lupus erythematosus,"Overview: is a chronic autoimmune disease of unknown cause that can affect virtually any organ of the body with the production of antinuclear antibodies (ANA). Presentation: wide variations from mild joint/skin disease to life threatening multiorgan failure. There is a no pathognomonic feature. Constitutional symptoms of fatigue, fever is common. Mucocutaneous symptoms of such as butterfly rash are commonly described. Arthritis occurs in most of the patients. Assessment: Diagnosis requires clinical judgment and is based on presenting symptoms, clinician should exclude all other differential diagnosis, along with supportive laboratory finding of ANA positivity. There are multiple diagnostic aids (criteria). ANA negative lupus has been recognized. Plan: Several non-pharmacologic therapies has been proposed. Hydroxychloroquine is commonly used. Immunosuppressive therapy including methylprednisone, azathioprine is used in acute exacerbations. Belimumab is approved for use in SLE by FDA. Prognosis: The disease course involves unpredictable flares and remissions. This is a lifelong chronic disease that may progress to multi organ failure with some known prognostic indicators such as young age at onset, preexisting renal disease, race etc.","{
