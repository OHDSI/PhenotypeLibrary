320749000,Polyarteritis nodosa,320749,"Overview: Inflammation of medium sized muscular arteries, occasionally involving small muscular arteries. It is a vasculitis. Does not involve veins. Presentation: Tender, red skin nodules, purpura (purple lesions), livedo reticularis (a lacy, red or blue flat patternon the skin), ulcers (loss of some or all of the layers of skin in a defined areas). Other skin changes are possible. Decreased kidney function, mono or polyneuropathy, and abdominal pain can be present. GI bleeding can also occur. heart muscle death can occur due to narrowing of the arteries of the heart. Any organ can be affected in PAN due to restriction of blood supply. Assessment: absence of ANCA (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies). Biopsy showing necrotizing vasculitis in the walls of medium sized arteries is the gold standard and should precede treatment. Confirm absence of viral hepatitis prior to treatment. Plan: Biopsy confirmed PAN with mild disease treated with glucocorticoids alone. Moderate to severe disease treated with glucocorticoids plus cyclophosphaide. Prognosis: Careful monitoring of end organ damage required, as well as monitoring for cyclophosphamide toxicity. Rheumatology consult for severe disease or treatment failures. Poor Prognosis: for untreated PAN (13 % five year survival) but in treated patients 80% five year survival.","",""
