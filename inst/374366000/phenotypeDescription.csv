374366000,Sensori neural hearing loss Deafness neurosensory,"Overview: Loss of functional hearing due to dysfunction of the nerve endings in the cochlea (in the inner ear), along the auditory nerve (cranial nerve VIII). Middle ear function is preserved (movement of the bones of the middle ear in response to the eardrum vibrating as the result of sound is intact) Presentation: Congenital, sudden, or gradual loss of hearing ability in one or both ears. May be mild, moderate, severe or profound. Assessment: Pure tone audiometry, speech recognition scales, if sudden in an adult in particular if it is unilateral, MRI or CT imaging for neoplasms in the brain or in the auditory nerve. Evaluate for infection (lumbar puncture if indicated) Plan: If underlying pathology can be treated, do so. Prognosis: Can worsen over time and with noise exposure."
