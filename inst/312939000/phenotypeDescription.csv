312939000,Thromboangiitis obliterans,"Overview: Previously known as Buerger's disease, TAO is characterized by  a nonatherosclerotic (not due to cholesterol plaque), segmental inflammatory thrombotic vessel occlusions, that affects the small to medium-sized arteries and veins of the extremities (upper and lower). It is distinguished pathologically from other forms of vasculitis by a highly cellular, inflammatory intraluminal thrombus but no fibrinoid necrosis and the presence of an intact internal elastic membrane. Although smoking is important to the pathogenesis, the specific etiologic mechanism remains unknown. Inflammatory, immunologic, and endothelial factors play a role.  Most common in young tobacco and marijuana smokers. Presentation: Ischemia of the distal extremities (fingers/toes/hands/feet), ischemic digit ulcers or digit gangrene. In people typically younger than age 45 years, the condition is distinguished from other forms of vasculitis by a highly cellular, inflammatory intraluminal thrombus with relative sparing of the vessel wall and, more specifically, sparing of the internal elastic lamina. Although distal vessel involvement causes distal ischemia in other vasculitides, serologic markers are negative in thromboangiitis obliterans. Assessment: Painful ulceration or ischemia of part or all of fingers/toes due to lack of blood supply not reversible with heat. Allen test (to evaluate for blood flow in the radial and ulnar artery) should be performed - if positive in the wrist of a young smoker is highy predictive of TAO. CBC, CMP, UA, serologies for sed rate, CRP, ANA, RF, complement, cryoglobulins, hyprecoagulability test, toxicology (cocaine, amphetamine, cannabis). Plan: Tobacco and/or marijuanna cessation. Calcium channel blockers, IV prostaglandins or phosphodiesterase inhibitorss to vasodilate. Interventional revascularization. Prognosis: Amputation of affected digits if medical therapy, revascularization and smoking cessation does not reverse the damages."
