36712702000,Preterm birth,"Overview: Prematurity is defined as a birth that occurs before 37 completed weeks (less than 259 days) of gestation. Delivery of the fetus between 20 and 37 weeks of gestation. Majority of PTB are spontaneous - due to preterm labor or preterm prelabor rupture of membranes. PTB is relatively common at upto 20%. Reproductive history of PTB is a major risk factor for recurrence. Presentation: Rupture of membranes (amniotic sac), contractions of uterus, dilation of cervix and delivery of infant. Sometimes a cesearean section is needed to deliver the fetus prematurely for medical reasons e.g fetal distress. Assessment: If in labor - speculum exam to confirm amniotic fluid, serial cervical exams, ultrasound to confirm presentation and plan for delivery or need for C section. Plan: If possible treat mother with corticosteroids to promote fetal lung maturity and reduced risk of respiratory distress post delivery; but very few interventions have proven successful in prolonging pregnancy period after labor has started. Treat any identified infections; magnesium sulfate as tocolytic. Prognosis: The less mature the fetus, in general the poorer prognosis. 20 weeks gestation considered the lower limit of survivability.","{
