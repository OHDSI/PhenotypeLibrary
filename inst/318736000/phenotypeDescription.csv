318736000,Migraine,"Overview: Migraine disorders are classes of debilitating, severe headaches with other physical symptoms. Prevalence has been estimated that 10-15% of all patients worldwide experience a migraine disorder at some point. Presentation: Symptoms include severe headaches, nausea, sensitivity to light an irritability. Two broad categories exist; those with and without visual auras. Gender appears to be a strong component, where women are approximately 3 times more likely to report migraines than men and reported symptoms are also more severe. Assessment: There is no formal diagnostic test for migraines. Diagnosis is achieved by reviewing family and patient medical history, physical examination and performing investigations to rule out other causes of the symptoms. A migraine disorder is classed as chronic when symptoms persist for >=15 days in a calendar month. Plan: Standard pain medication such as ibuprohen or acetaminophen is suggested for initial treatment. Triptans or ergotamines are suggested where simple pain medication does not help. There is no cure or widely accepted treatment thought to prevent most causes of migraine. Prognosis: Migraine disorders are debilitating conditions that have no clear path of treatment with many patients having problems throughout their lives."
