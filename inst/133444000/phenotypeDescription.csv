133444000,Thyroiditis,"Overview: diverse group of disorders characterized by some form of thyroid inflammation, causing acute or chronic, painful or painless thyroiditis. Major diagnostic criterias are dominated by presence of pain and tenderness. Pain and tenderness occurs with subacute thyroiditis with unregulated thyroid hormone level fluctuations - includes de Quervains, subacute granulomatous - thought to post viral illness. Infectious thyroiditis is also painful and tender and may be acute - e.g. bacterial with abscess suppurative, or chronic infection.  Pain and tenderness is absense in silent/lymphocytic/painless thyroiditis that may occur secondary to autoimmune causes (hashimotos). Postpartum thyroiditis is known to occur within 1 year of parturition - and history of pregnancy is an important classifier. Drugs like interferon alfa, interleukin-2, amiodarone, lithium, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, check point inhibitors immunotherapy may cause painless non tender thyroiditis. Presentation: Painful thyroiditis has obvious symptoms of pain in thyroid region, seasonality (summer) in pattern may exist because etiology is commonly thought to be post viral. Painless thyroiditis have history of hyperthyroidism like symptoms followed by hypothyroidism - however rarely are these symptoms severe, and are almost always transient many go undetected. Assessment: TSH followed by T3 and T4. Physical exam to confirm tenderness. Subacute/acute thyroiditis is a clinical diagnosis. Medication review, anti thyroid antibodies, thyroid ultrasound. Plan: Find and treat underlying cause of thyroid inflammation (medications, surgery). Beta blockers for bothersome thyroiditis. If symptomatic hypothyroidism, consider T4 (levothyroxine) therapy. Pain management if needed. Prognosis: Typically excellent prognosis."
