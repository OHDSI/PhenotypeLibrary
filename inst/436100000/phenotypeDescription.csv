436100000,Narcolepsy,"Overview: Narcolepsy is a clinical syndrome of daytime sleepiness with cataplexy (type 1 narcolepsy has cataplexy, type 2 does not), hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. It is one of the most common causes of disabling daytime sleepiness after obstructive sleep apnea. Cataplexy is emotionally-triggered transient muscle weakness - such as laughter or excitement. Presentation: Associated after vaccination with the H1N1 vaccination in Sweden (Pandemrix) within 2 weeks of vaccination in 2010-2011. Assessment: Sleep studies (polysymnographic testing including the Multiple Sleep Latency Test), CSF evaluation for neuropeptide hypocretin-1 (orexin A) (hyposecretion of this neuropeptide is a diagnostic biomarker for narcolepsy). Plan: Treat reversible causes (sleep apnea, infections), withdraw or do not continue to expose to provoking agent, personal safety including driving safety. Stimulants for daytime sleepiness, REM sleep suppressing drugs for cataplexy. Prognosis: Treatments unfortunately fail to help patients with narcolepsy feel fully alert. Psychosocial support. Weight management. Sleep specialist consult. 2-4 fold increased risk for motor vehicle accdent compared to non-narcoleptics.","{
