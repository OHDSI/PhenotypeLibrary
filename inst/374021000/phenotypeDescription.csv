374021000,Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis,374021,"Overview: A post-infectious autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Uncommon but more frequent in children than adults Presentation: An infectious illness followed after days to months lag time by multifocal neurologic signs and encephalopathy (altered mental status)(required for the diagnosis). Most patients have motor deficits (single or multiple limb paralysis), sensory deficits, and brainstem dysfunction (oculomotor deficits). Encephalopathy not explained by other causes. Assessment: MRI brain with diffuse poorly demarcated lesions in cerebral white matter, deep gray matter lesions. CSF analysis, serum autoantibodies,. Plan: Immune supporession with glucocorticoids; empiric acyclovir until infectious etiology excluded, IVIG or plasma exchange for treatment failures. Supportive care. Prognosis: Complete recovery only occurs in 10-46 percent of adult patients. Death may result in severe cases. Relapses likely indicate multiple sclerosis, initial presentation very difficult to distinguish from multiple sclerosis.",NA,NA
