4139034000,Immune reconstitution syndrome,"Overview: abbreviated IRIS. a collection of inflammatory disorders associated with paradoxical worsening of preexisting infectious processes following the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-infected individuals. Synonyms - Immune recovery disease, Immune reconstitution disease, Immune reconstitution syndrome, Immune restoration disease, Immune rebound illness, Steroid-withdrawal disease, Immunorestitution disease, Immune response reactions. There is no universally agreed-upon definition for the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). However, it is generally accepted that the diagnosis of IRIS requires the worsening of a recognized (""paradoxical"" IRIS) or unrecognized preexisting infection (""unmasking"" IRIS) in the setting of improving immunologic function. Presentation: Symptoms associated with prior infections at the site of pre-existing infection (for example, people with HIV on ART who were previously treated for pulmonary tuberculosis may have new fevers, malaise, weight loss and worsening respiratory symptoms). Multiple infections previously cleared by the patient can be the culprit: cryptococcus, CMV, JC virus, pneumocystis, Hepatitis B and C, for example. Assessment: Distinguish from active infection with history and physical examination, including opportunistic infections. Plan: Supportive care and glucocorticoids may be needed for severe symptoms. Treat for opportunistic infections if indicated. Continue ART. Prognosis: Usually self-limited with good prognosis."
