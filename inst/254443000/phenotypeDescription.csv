254443000,Sjögren's syndrome,254443,"Overview: Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder that is characterized by diminished lacrimal and salivary gland function. Primary form of SS occurs in isolation, while secondary forms maybe a complication or overlap with other rheumatic conditions, most commonly rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).Presentation: Sjogren’s syndrome is commonly associated with dryness and its sequela, pruritus, and in severe forms it may have extraglandular manifestations. Assessment: SS is suspected based on symptoms of persistent dry eyes, mouth, parotid gland enlargement, unexplained dental caries. Nonspecific but supportive of diagnosis are abnormal results of serologic tests - anti-Ro/SSA antibodies with or without anti-La/SSB antibodies. There is no single diagnostic test for SS.Plan: Ameliorate symptoms, prevent dryness related mucosal complicationsPrognosis: Chronic lifelong when not managed leads to reduced quality of life. With good management, DM induced end organ damage such as chronic kidney disease may be reduced.",,
