313800000,Thrombotic microangiopathy,"Overview: TMA is potentially life threatening condition due to abnormalities in the vessel wall of arterioles and capillaries leading to microvascular thrombosis. It almost always leads to microagniopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) and thrombocytopenia - but MAHA and thrombocytopenia may be caused by several other conditions. Before making diagnosis of TMA, other systemic disorders that can cause MAHA and thrombocytopenia need to be excluded including - HELLP syndrome, systemic malignanices, sepsis and systemic infections, systemic rheumatic disorders like SLE, systemic sclerosis, stem cell or organ transplant, DIC etc. TMA is classified into two main types, Primary TMA (heriditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura TTP, acquired TTP, shiga toxin mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome (ST-HUS), drug-induced TMA (DITMA) sydrome, complement-mediated TMA. DITMA is an acquired condition resulting from exposure to a drug (eg, medication, other substance) that induces formation of drug-dependent antibodies or causes direct tissue toxicity that results in the formation of platelet-rich thrombi in small arterioles or capillaries. Presentation: Common initial presentations include unexplained anemia or thrombocytopenia, unexplained neurologic findings (suspected stroke or transient ischemic attack), or other acute illness. Diarrhoes if ST-HUS. Assessment: peripheral smear to confirm anemia, hemolysis and/or thrombocytopenia. Tissue biopsy (usually of kidney) is required for pathologic diagnosis, but clinical diagnosis is commonly performed by the observation of microagniopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) and thrombocytopenia.  LDH, evaluate for shiga toxin (especially in the presence of hemolytic uremic syndrome), serum creatinine, urine output daily. Exclude other systemic disorder (HELLP). Plan: Treatment of underlyng condition, plasma exchange, or anti-complement therapy. revascularization for cardiac microangiopathy. platelet transfusion for severe thrombocytopenia, red blood cell transfusion for severe anemia. Prognosis: Poor in the absence of therapy, including myocardial ischemia, renal failure."
