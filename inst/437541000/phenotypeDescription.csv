437541000,Glaucoma,"Overview: A group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve (connecting the eye to the brain). Most common is open-angle (wide-angle) glaucoma, and angle-closure (narrow-angle) glaucoma is rare. Linked to a buildup of pressure inside the eye. Presentation: Slow vision loss with open-angle, but angle-closure is a medical emergency (eye pain w/ nausea and sudden visual changes - seeing halos around lights, eye redness, eye pain) Assessment: usually later in life, open-angle usually no symptoms but can have loss of vision. eye exam including glaucoma testing = tonometry, ophthalmoscopy, perimetry, gonioscopy, pachymetryPlan: regular eye exams, prescription eye drops to lower eye pressure (prostaglandins, beta blockers, Alpha-adrenergic agonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, Rho kinase inhibitor, and miotic or cholinergic drugs; laser therapy and surgical procedures Prognosis: Can cause permanent vision loss or even total blindness within a few years. Damage caused by glaucoma cannot be reversed.","{
