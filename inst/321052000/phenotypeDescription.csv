321052000,Peripheral vascular disease,"Overview: Peripheral vascular disease is peripheral artery disease (PAD) i.e. vascular here refers to artery and not venous or lymphatic disease. Peripheral here represents noncoronary vasculature and the underlying disease is limited to atherosclerotic disease causing peripheral artery obstruction. aka- arteriosclerosis obliterans, arterial insufficiency of the legs, claudication, and intermittent claudication. Lower limb ischemia is the most common subtype. Different from Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger disease) and Raynaud phenomenon (RP, idiopathic, immune mediated) that are non atherosclerotic and distinct. Also distinct of vessel disease that may lead to ischemia such as arterial aneurysm, dissection, embolism etc. Presentation: Intermittent claudication pain beginning after age 40 years. Severe disease may lead ischemic rest pain. Non healing ulcers may be observed in extreme cases. Reduced hair growth on legs, skin color changes (reddish blue or pale), weak pulses (in legs and feet) are seen. Assessment: Measuring the pulses in legs and feet, doppler ultrasound, ankle-brachial index (ABI), angiography, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), computerized tomography angiography (CTA). Plan: Lifestyle changes - tobacco cessation, exercise, and a healthy diet. Medications (cilostazol or pentoxifylline, clopidogrel, aspirin, statins, ACE inhibitors), angioplasty or vascular surgery. Prognosis: No cure. PVD responds to lifestyle treatments and medications as needed.","{
