43021132000,Toxic metabolic encephalopathy,"Overview: aka encephalopathy, ICU syndrome, ICU psychosis. Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy (TME) is an acute condition of global cerebral dysfunction without primary structural brain disease that encompasses delirium and acute confusional state. it is thought to be due to organic stress on CNS during critical illness. TME is common among critically ill patients, and is usually a consequence of systemic illness. Alcohol withdrawl syndrome related delirium is not included. Specific subtypes - septic encephalopathy, hepatic encephalopathy, uremic encephalopathy, hyponatremic or hypernatremic encephalopathy, wernicke encephalopathy - confusion, ataxia and opathalmoplegia, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, posst transplanation encephalopathy. Exclude other causes such as alcohol withdrawl, meningitis, encephalitis, brain tumors, nonconvulsive seizures, traumatic brain injury, right hemisphere stroke, etc. Presentation: non specific, but with some combination of confusion and delirium - more common in older individuals. Confusion is inability to maintain a coherent stream of thought or action. Delirium is a confusional state with superimposed hyperactivity of the sympathetic limb of the autonomic nervous system with consequent signs including tremor, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and mydriasis. In TME, level of alertness is an indicator of severity. Assessment: lumbar puncture to exclude meningitis. EEG may show global cerebral dysfunction and exclude subclinical seizures. CT/MRI of brain. Plan: treat the underlying cause. physical restraints if needed. Haloperidol for agitation. Thiamine for history of alcoholism, malnutrition, cancer, renal failure etc. Prognosis: depends on the underlying cause. In rare cases may progress into structural brain damage.","{
