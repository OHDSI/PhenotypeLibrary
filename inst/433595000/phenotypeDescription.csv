433595000,Edema,433595,"Overview: Edema is palpable swelling produced by expansion of the interstitial fluid volume. Massive edema is sometime called anasarca. Although the term edema is broad and includes peripheral edema, pulmonary edema, ascites, and other forms of edema, which include lymphedema, nonpitting edema, and periorbital and scrotal edema - this phenotype is limited to peripheral edema.Presentation: Peripheral edema commonly occurs in gravity dependent areas like legs and buttocks. Edema may be pitting or nonpitting; with pitting edema being more common. Pitting edema is defined by the presence of tissue depression after pressure is applied to the edematous area for at least five seconds.Assessment: Peripheral edema is rarely life threatening by itself compared to pulmonary edema. The cause of peripheral edema maybe identified with detail history and whether the edema is localized or generalized. Plan: Treat the cause where possible. Diuretic may be used for some types of generalized retention edema (e.g. congestive heart failure, cirrhosis)Prognosis: depends on underlying cause. Chronic peripheral edema may lead to fibrosis in tissue.","",""
