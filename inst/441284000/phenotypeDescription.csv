441284000,Open-angle glaucoma,"Overview: The angle in your eye where the iris meets the cornea is as wide and open as it should be, but the eye's drainage canals become clogged over time, causing an increase in internal eye pressure and subsequent damage to the optic nervePresentation: Typically no early warning signs or painful symptoms. By the time a patient is aware of vision loss, the disease is usually quite advanced. Early on, start to lose peripheral vision. Assessment: Eye examinations, check eye pressure, measure cornea thickness Plan: Can’t fix damage to the optic nerve or the vision problems that follow. Need to slow glaucoma’s progress down - prostaglandins, beta-blockers. laser therapy or surgery. Prognosis: Without treatment, glaucoma can lead to blindness. No cure for glaucoma, gets worse over time.","{
