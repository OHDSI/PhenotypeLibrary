138379000,Chronic lymphoid leukemia,"Overview: mature B cell neoplasm characterized by a progressive accumulation of monoclonal B lymphocytes. Similar to non-Hodgkins lymphoma SLL, but the key difference is that this disease manifests primarily in blood, while SLL in primarily lymph node. Presentation: most commonly asymptomatic and detected on routine blood test with abnormal lymphocytosis. Occassionally there may be constitutional symptoms like unexplained weight loss, fevers, night sweats, fatigue. CLL does not have lymphadenopathy while non-HL/SLL does. Assessment: Suspected when there is absolute lymphocytosis on peripheral smear. periheral blood/bone marrow cell counts, immunophenotypic analysis (flow cytometry), bone marrow biopsy/aspirate, lymph node biopsy/aspirate, spleen. Plan: depends on activity of disease/stage; the disease is extremelly heterogenous. Nodal diseae may involve radiation therapy. There is no single agreed first line therapy. Prognosis: chronic disease but may be asymptomatic with minimal progression, or may progress quickly","{
