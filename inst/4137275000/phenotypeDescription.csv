4137275000,Vasculitis,"Overview: (plural: vasculitides) are serious and sometimes fatal diseases that require prompt recognition and therapy. They are defined by the presence of inflammatory leukocytes in vessel walls (sign of inflammation) with reactive damage to mural structures that may lead to compromised lumen with restriction of blood flow to tissues and associated acute or chronic organ/tissue damage. Also known as angiitis and arteritis - the naming conventions are changing with eponyms being replaced. Most important recent name changes include 'eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis EGPA' for Churg-Strauss syndrome; 'granulomatosis with polyangiitis GPA' for Wegener's granulomatosis; 'immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis IgAV' for Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP); 'anti-C1q vasculitis' for 'hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis'; 'cryoglobulinemic vasculitis' for essential cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) includes three disorders - microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), GPA, and EGPA. Non-infectious vasculitides are classified primarily by the predominant vessel involved - although some forms of vasculitis may not show predilection to one vessel type. Large Vessel Vasculitis (Takayasu’s arteritis, Giant cell arteritis); Medium vessel arteritis (polyarteritis nodosa, Kawasaki disease - mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome); Small vessel vasculitis (ANCA associated vasculitis, MPA (GPA, EGPA), Immune complex small vessel vasculitis (anti glomerular basement membrane disease - GBM, Cryoglobulinemic, IgA, anti-C1a; variable vessel (Behçet , Cogan).  Single organ cutaneous vasculitis (Cutaneous small vessel vasculitis) is a syndrome defined as a single-organ, skin-isolated small vessel vasculitis or angiitis, without systemic vasculitis or glomerulonephritis i.e. without the involvement of other organ systems such as the heart, lungs, GI system, kidney or arthritis - and may be due to medication exposure (common etiology) such as penicillins, cephalosporins, sulfonamides (including most loop and thiazide-type diuretics), phenytoin, and allopurinol, or infections such as Hepatitis B/C, HIV, chronic bacteremias like endocarditis, shunts. Kawasaki's, aka mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome is a vasculitides of childhood (rare in adults), typically self-limited with fever and inflammation lasting about 2 weeks without therapy, but may lead to complications such as coronary artery aneurysms, heart failure, myocardial infarction, arrythmia, peripheral arterial occlusion.  Henoch-Schönlein purpura is the most common form of systemic vasculitis in children, a primarily pediatric condition that is an IgA mediated vasculitis most commonly seen in ages 3-15 years, with predominant occurrence in winter often one to two weeks after a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Presentation: Vasculitis is rare but should be considered in patients who present with systemic or constitutional symptoms in combination with evidence of single and/or multiorgan dysfunction. Include, fever, headache, fatigue, wt loss, general aches and pains, night sweats, rash, numbness or weakness. Behçet is associated with painful, recurrent oral ulcers M > F. Kawasaki has fever (> 5 days) with signs of mucocutaneous inflammation (fissured lips, injected pharynx, strawberry tongue, mucositis), bilateral bulbar conjunctival injection, erythema of palms or soles, edema, desquamation of periungual areas, polymorphous rash, cervical lymphadenopathy, arthritis. Henoch-Schönlein purpura is characterized by tetrad of manifestations of palpable purpura  (raised purple lesions, symmetrically distributed over legs and buttocks, trunk usually spared) in patients with neither thrombocytopenia nor coagulopathy, arthritis/arthralgia, abdominal pain and renal disease. Assessment: C-reactive protein, CBC, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies test, urinalysis, x-rays, ultrasound, CT, MRI, PET, angiography, biopsy (affected area). Plan: Control the inflammation and resolve underlying disease triggering the vasculitis. If due to external exposure, identify and discontinue. Remission induction and remission maintenance using corticosteroids, steroid-sparing meds. Disease specific treatments are possible for some sub-types. Maintenance may include surgery if vasculitis caused an aneurysm or blocked arteries. Prognosis: Limited data. Depends on type of vasculitis and organs involved and how serious. Some initial success with treatment, some have flare-ups, and some vasculitis does not go away and requires ongoing treatment. IVIG for Kawasaki’s may reduce complications such as coronary artery aneurysm. Henoch-Schönlein purpura is typically self limited."
