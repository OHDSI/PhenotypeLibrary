321319000,Cardiomyopathy,"Overview: Cardiomyopathies were originally defined as disorders that were idiopathic, but in North American clinical practice the terms ""ischemic,"" ""valvular,"" and ""hypertensive cardiomyopathy"" were commonly used causing dismbiguation. Multiple attempts were made including2006 AHA scientific statement definition ""Cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous group of diseases of the myocardium associated with mechanical and/or electrical dysfunction that usually (but not invariably) exhibit inappropriate ventricular hypertrophy or dilation and are due to a variety of causes that frequently are genetic. Cardiomyopathies either are confined to the heart or are a part of generalized systemic disorders, often leading to cardiovascular death or progressive heart failure-related disability."" Two groups: primary cardiomyopathies (predominantly involving the heart) and secondary cardiomyopathies (accompanied by other organ system involvement). The primary cardiomyopathies are subdivided into genetic, mixed (predominantly nongenetic), or acquired (nongenetic). The genetic cardiomyopathies include Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D), left ventricular noncompaction, PRKAG2 and Danon glycogen storage diseases, conduction defects, mitochondrial myopathies, and ion channel disorders. The mixed cardiomyopathies include Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM). The acquired cardiomyopathies include myocarditis, stress-induced (takotsubo), peripartum, tachycardia-induced, and infants of insulin-dependent diabetic mothers. This was followed in 2008 by ESC, as ""A myocardial disorder in which the heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal in the absence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular disease and congenital heart disease sufficient to explain the observed myocardial abnormality"". The clinical ideas describing the breadth of cardiomyopathy is still evolving but functionally echocardiogram evaluation is a functional way to classify cardiomyopathy into either dilated, hypertrophic, arrhythmogenic right ventricular, or restrictive cardiomyopathy. Systolic dysfunction is characterized by a decrease in myocardial contractility, i.e. myocardial contractility is decreased globally and commonly compensated thru LV enlargementi.e. dilated cardiomyopathy. Diastolic dysfunction refers to cardiac dysfunction in which LV relaxation and filling is abnormal and is accompanied by elevated filling pressures (eg, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, LV noncompaction), valvular heart disease, pericardial disease. Some cardiac disorders may present as more than one type of cardiomyopathy e.g. amyloid cardiomyopathy with both hypertrophic and restrictive. Cardiac sarcoidosis with wall motion abnormality and ventricular arrythmias. DCM, with Left ventricular cavity dilatation, is associated with viruses and gene mutations. some definitions exclude ischemic cardiomyopathy which appears similar to DCM. In general HCM, would not include pathologic hypertrophy secondary to pathologic loading conditions such as hypertension and valve disease. Atheletes heart, i.e. physiologic cardiomyopathy is not considered cardiomyopathy. RCM is characterized by nondilated ventricles with impaired ventricular filling, commonly without muscle hypertrophy but wall may appear thick because of infiltrative disease (amyloidosis) or storage disease (Fabry). Stress Cardiomyopathy, aka apical ballooning syndrome, takotsubo cardiomyopathy, broken heart syndrome, and stress-induced cardiomyopathy, is a type of acquired cardiomyopathy characterized by transient regional systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle (LV), mimicking myocardial infarction, but in the absence of angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease or acute plaque rupture. In most cases of stress cardiomyopathy, the regional wall motion abnormality extends beyond the territory perfused by a single epicardial coronary artery. Presentation: Cardiomyopathy may present with broad set of signs and symptoms including fatigure, dyspnea, chest pain, palpitations, presyncope and syncope and depends on whether the person is functional vs decompensated. Assessment: ECG often with QTc prolongation greather than 500 ms; ecocardiogram, urgent coronary angiography (for this diagnosis, there needs to be an absence of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease). Troponin and BNP or proBNP serial levels. Plan: Highly personalized care. Manage heart failure, arrythmias, rehabilitation, education. Anticoagulation sometimes indicated. Prognosis: depends on degree of damage. Many with HCM may have normal life expectancy. Prognosis: worse with older age and abnormal left heart pump function (LVEF<40%). Risk of sudden cardiac death. May benefit from cardiac transplantation.","{
