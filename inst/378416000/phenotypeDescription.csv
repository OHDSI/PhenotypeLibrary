378416000,Retinal disorder,"Overview: Common retinal conditions include floaters, macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, retinal tear or detachment, and retinitis pigmentosa. Retinal diseases can affect any part of the retina. Presentation: Sudden appearance of floaters, flashes of light (photopsia), blurred vision, reduced peripheral vision, or loss of vision Assessment: Eye exams, Amsler grid test, Optical coherence tomography (OCT), Fundus autofluorescence (FAF), angiography, ultrasoundPlan: Laser surgery, scatter laser photocoagulation, cryopexy, pneumatic retinopexy, scleral buckling, vitrectomy, injecting medicine into the eye, retinal prosthesis Prognosis: Can stop or slow the disease and preserve, improve or restore vision. Untreated, can cause severe vision loss or blindness.","{
