4260535000,Colonic diverticulitis,"Overview: The term 'Colonic diverticulitis' would imply 'acute colonic diverticulitis with or without complications'. Diverticulitis is defined as inflammation of a diverticulum. A diverticulum is a sac-like protrusion of the colonic wall. Diverticulosis is defined by the presence of diverticula. Diverticulosis may be asymptomatic or symptomatic. Diverticular disease is defined as clinically significant and symptomatic diverticulosis due to diverticular bleeding, diverticulitis, segmental colitis associated with diverticula, or symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease. Diverticulitis is a sub-type of diverticular disease that maybe acute or chronic, uncomplicated or complicated (abscess, fistula, bowel obstruction, perforation). Acute diverticulitis is defined as inflammation, generally considered to be due to microperforation of a diverticulum. Simple or uncomplicated diverticulitis is defined as acute diverticulitis without an associated complication. Complicated diverticulitis is defined as diverticulitis with one of the following associated complications: bowel obstruction, abscess, fistula, or perforation. Diverticular bleeding may be painless hematochezia. Segmental colitis is inflammation in the interdiverticular mucosa without involving diverticular orifice. Symptomatic diverticular disease may have pain without observable inflammation. Presentation: Approximately 4% of diverticulosis develop acute diverticulitis. Presentation depends on the severity of underlying inflammation and complications. Abdominal pain, usually in the left lower quadrant, abdominal tenderness, and elevated white blood cells. Assessment: CT scan often shows thickening of the colon wall, can show abscess (or perforation if present). Plan: If not tolerating PO intake, then admission to hospital, bowel rest, antibiotics, surgical consult. If tolerating PO, oral antibiotics, bland diet. Colonoscopy when the acute event concludes. Prognosis: Good short term, but if multiple attacks may need surgery to excise the affected portion of the colon."
