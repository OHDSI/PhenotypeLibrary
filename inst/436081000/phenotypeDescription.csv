436081000,Immunosecretory disorder,"Overview: To do. The immunosecretory disorders are a diverse group of diseases associated with proliferation of an abnormal clone of immunoglobulin (Ig)-synthesizing, terminally differentiated B cells. These disorders include multiple myeloma (MM) and its variants, plasmacytoma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, and monoclonal Ig deposition diseases, the latter including primary amyloidosis and nonamyloidotic types. These disorders are histologically composed of plasma cells, or plasmacytoid cells which produce Ig that is synthesized and usually secreted and can be deposited in some diseases. The Ig can be complete or can be composed of either heavy or light chains and is termed M-(monoclonal) protein.","{
