4246127000,Liver cancer,"Overview: Hepatic cancer. Most common type of liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma, which begins in the main type of liver cell (hepatocyte). Other types of liver cancer, such as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and hepatoblastoma, are much less common. Most liver cancers have links to cirrhosis. Presentation: Early stages of primary liver cancer (no symptoms). Can include, losing weight, loss of appetite, upper abdominal pain, N/V, wekness and fatigue, abdominal swelling, jaundice and white, chalky stools. Assessment: Liver function tests, elevated alpha fetoprotein (AFP), imaging tests, liver biopsy. Plan: Immunotherapy, chemotherapy, localized treatments - Radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, Chemoembolization, radiation - stereotactic body radiotherapy. Surgery (remove the tumor), liver transplant Prognosis: he outlook for liver cancer is poor. People often identify liver cancer at a late stage. Depends on staging, size and location of cancer and whether it has spread.","{
