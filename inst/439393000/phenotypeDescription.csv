439393000,Pre-eclampsia,439393,"Overview: Development of high blood pressure (>140 systolic) and protein in the urine in a pregnant woman after 20 weeks of gestation. Presentation: Two readings of systolic blood pressure >= 140 at least one hour apart AND protein greater than or equal to 300 mg on 24 hour urine collection. Usually asymptomatic. Assessment: Blood pressure monitoring, 24 hour urine protein collection. Once diagnosed, pregnancy considered high risk. Monitor liver enzymes, platelets for development of HELLP. Monitor reflexes for hyperreactivity. Plan: The cure for preeclampsia is delivery of the fetus if the disease becomes severe (showing early signs of end organ damage). Monitoring of amniotic fluid index, nonstress testing, fetal biometry to monitor for intrauterin growth restriction. management of blood pressure with antihypertensives such as nifedipine or labetalol. If pre-eclampsia develops severe features, admit and treat with MgSO4 for convulvion prophylaxis. Prognosis: Sequelae of pre-eclampsia can include small for dates baby, preterm birth, HELLP syndrome, seizures, death. Careful monitoring of blood pressure and urine throughout pregnancy allows for early intervention to mitigate risk.",,
439393000,Pre-eclampsia,439393,"Overview: Preeclampsia is a multisystem progressive disorder that is characterized by the new onset of hypertension and proteinuria. Significant end-organ dysfunction, e.g. proteinuria maybe present. Pre-eclampsia commonly occurs in last half of pregnancy and in postpartum period. If the women was hypertensive prior to pregnancy, then it is consider preeclampsia superimposed on  hypertenson. Sign of end organ damage such as protienuria is needed for diagnosis, hypertension in the absence of such an evidence of end organ damage may be considered gestational hypertension. Presentation: is non specific and requires a high degree of suspicion. symptoms may include headache, epigastric pain, oliguria, peripheral edema. Plan: check blood pressure and signs of end organ damage. Severe preeclampsia is an indication for induced delivery. Prognosis: can progress to eclampsia which may be fatal. Disease is considered progressive during pregnancy and early post partum period.",,
