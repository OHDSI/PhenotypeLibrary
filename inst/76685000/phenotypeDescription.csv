76685000,Myasthenia gravis,76685,"Overview: The most common disorder of neuromuscular transmission. Autoimmune. Two major types: ocular (eye muscles and eyelids involved) and generalized disease (ocular, bulbar, limb and/or respiratory muscles involved) Presentation: Fluctuating skeletal muscle weakness which worsens later in the day and after exercise. Double vision or ptosis (weakness of the eyelid muscles). Difficulty speaking swallowing or fatigue with chewing. Difficulty smiling. weak neck muscles. Severe cases involve weakness of respiratory muscles. Assessment: serum antibodies to acetylcholine receptor (AChR), muscle specific receptor tyrosine kinase (muSK) or lipoprotein receptor related protein 4 (LPR4). One half of patients with MG are seropositive for one of these antibodies. Chest CT to evaluate for thymoma (neoplasm of the thymus, which is a fetal remnant initially responsible for maturation of T cells). EMG. Plan: Pyridostigmine (inhibits breakdown of ACh by the acetylcholinesterase so nerves work better) steroids and NSAIDs, short acting therapies such as plasma exchange and IVIG. Thymectomy as a last resort (surgery to remove thymus). Avoid drugs which exacerbate symptoms (fluorquinolone antibiotics, careful use of anesthesia agents, magnesium sulfate, checkpoint inhibitors). Respiratory infections can exacerbate MS, so annual flu vaccination and q5-10 year pneumonia vaccination recommended. AVOID LIVE ATTENUATED VACCINES. Prognosis: Symptoms are initially transient with symptom free intervals. Symptoms typically worsen over time and reach their worst within 3 years. Can be fatal if respiratory muscle involvement is not addressed.",,
