4185932000,Ischemic heart disease,"Overview: Ischemic heart disease includes acute (unstable), chronic (stable) and acute on chronic (unstable) ischemic heart disease. Chronic coronary syndrome, stable ischemic heart disease, coronary heart disease, coronary artery disease, are terms used to describe a syndrome due to inadequate supply of blood to the myocardium due to obstruction of the epicardial coronary arteries, usually from atherosclerosis (arteriosclerosis is vessel narrowing, hardening. atherosclerosis is a subtype of arteriosclerosis due to cholestrol plaque). This is distinct from Acute Coronary syndrome (acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina). Although a few people in this category may have acute (unstable) disease, the vast majority have a chronic (stable) disease - stable ischemic heart disease. Unless otherwise specified, this phenotype describes individuals with such chronic stable disease. While some may have history of prior myocardial infaction, others may have had silent infarction of heart that was incidentally found. An important subtype is left main coronary artery disease (LMCAD) and is a diagnosis made via coronary arteriography, and maybe suggested based on ECG pattern on stress testing. Left main equivalent disease, defined as severe (≥70 percent) proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and proximal left circumflex disease. Presentation: People with this disease may have Angina pectoris, chest discomfort that occurs predictably and reproducibly at a certain level of exertion and is relieved with rest or nitroglycerin. Many maybe asymptomatic with symptoms only detected in stress testing. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia frequently present. Assessment: extent and severity of coronary disease can be assessed by stress testing, cardiac imaging, and angiography. history or pathologic Q waves on an electrocardiogram, or wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram may help identify old myocardial infarction. Plan: secure the diagnosis, assess the extent of disease, relieve symptoms, and prevent future cardiac events such as acute coronary syndromes. Risk reduction (control of hypertension, lipids, weight loss, control of diabetes, exercise, antiplatelet therapy), antianginal therapy use of nitrites. Decrease cardiac demands with calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, supportive care. If LMCAD is detected, strong consider revascularization including coronary artery bypass graft. Prognosis: Coronary artery disease can lead to fatal myocardial infarction without adequate management. Most patients with significant LMCAD are symptomatic and are at higher risk of cardiovascular events, without revascularization, three-year survival is as low as 30% - CABG is recommended over PCI (controversial).","{
