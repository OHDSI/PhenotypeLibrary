4164770000,Guillain-Barré syndrome,4164770,"Overview: Progressive, systemic muscle weakness with absent or depressed deep tendon reflexes due to immune response from prior infection that cross reacts with peripheral nerve components due to molecular mimicry towards the myelin or axon of the peripheral nerve (demyelinating disease). Campylobacter, CMV, EBV, HIV and Zika known to precede GBS. Rarely, immunization, surgery, trauma and bone marrow transplantation can cause. Presentation: Highly variable severity and involvement - typically progresses over 2 weeks. Required features: progressive weakness of legs and arms, trunk, bulbar and facial muscles, and external ophthalmoplegia; areflexia or decreased reflexes in weak limbs. Supportive features: progressive symptoms over time, symmetry, autonomic dysfunction, elevated CSF protein with cell count less than 50/mm^3. Many variants of GBS - AIPD, Miller Fisher Syndrome, Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy. 1-2 cases per 100,000 people/year. Incidence increased with age, male sex. Assessment: History of physical, CSF analysis, electrodiagnostic studies, MRI spine MRI brain Plan: If severe respiratory muscle weakness present, ventilatory support needed (10-30% of patients), supportive care including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function; plasma exchange or IVIG; rehabilitation, Prognosis: Poor for older age, rapid onset, severe muscle weakness on admisison, need for ventilatory support, severely abnormal EMG, preceding diarrheal illness.
