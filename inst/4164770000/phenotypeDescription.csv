4164770000,Guillain-Barré syndrome,"Overview: is a group of heterogenous acute immune-mediated polyneuropathic conditions that most commonly presents as acute, monophasic paralyzing illness provoked by previous infection (molecular mimicry hypothesis). Campylobacter (most common), CMV, EBV, HIV and Zika known to precede GBS. Rarely, immunization, surgery, trauma and bone marrow transplantation can cause. Presentation: Cardinal presentation is progressive, systemic muscle weakness with absent or depressed deep tendon reflexes, but may be highly variable severity and involvement. It typically progresses over 2 weeks. The clinical variant Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), characterized by ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. Required features - progressive weakness of legs and arms, trunk, bulbar and facial muscles, and external ophthalmoplegia; areflexia or decreased reflexes in weak limbs. Supportive features - progressive symptoms over time, symmetry, autonomic dysfunction, elevated CSF protein with cell count less than 50/mm^3. Many variants of GBS - AIPD, Miller Fisher Syndrome, Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy. 1-2 cases per 100,000 people/year. Incidence increased with age, male sex. Assessment: History of physical, CSF analysis, electrodiagnostic studies, MRI spine MRI brain. Nerve conduction studies abnormal (normal in Miller Fisher syndrome). Plan: If severe respiratory muscle weakness present, ventilatory support needed (10-30% of patients), supportive care including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function; plasma exchange or IVIG; rehabilitation. Prognosis: Poor for older age, rapid onset, severe muscle weakness on admisison, need for ventilatory support, severely abnormal EMG, preceding diarrheal illness.
