433736000,Obesity,"Overview: Weight above what's considered healthy, often measured using body mass index (BMI). In adults, obestiy is defined as having a BMI (body mass index) of 30.0 or more. Obesity means having too much body fat. Presentation: High or increasing body mass index (BMI). Assessment: Measures of body fat including skinfold thickness tests, waist-to-hip comparisons, look also at obesity-related health risks (cholesterol and glucose levels, LFTs, diabetes screening, thyroid tests). Plan: Lifestyle changes/weight loss, eating and excercise plans, prescription weight loss medications, bariatric surgery Prognosis: Obesity has been linked to a number of health complications, some of which can be life threatening if not treated. Modest weight loss can improve or prevent health problems associated with obesity.","{
