375806000,Idiopathic Peripheral neuropathy,"Overview: Painful, symmetric condition with sensory, or sensory-motor, involvement. Can be triggered by immunization (in which case it is a vasculitic peripheral neuropathy), infections, drugs, metabolic causes. Presentation: Sensory or sensory-motor usually painful staring in the distal extremities (most commonly toes) related to length of the axon (longer axon=earlier symptoms) Worsens over the course of weeks. Pain is asymmetric, can experience numbness. Assessment: EMG with axonal pathology, r/o toxins, r/o Hep B and C infection, r/o Lyme, HIV, alcohol abuse, r/o diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, TSH, systemic vasculitidies, consider peripheral nerve biopsy to evaluate for vasculitis. Plan: Treat underlying cause, (withdraw offending drugs, treat infection, do not rechallenge with vaccine), observation usually appropriate. Worsening clinical course requires neurology consult. Prognosis: self-limited if offending agent withdrawn, progressive if untreated metabolic disorder or autoimmune etiology.","{
