197320000,Acute kidney injury or Acute renal failure syndrome,197320,"Overview: Acute Kidney Injury (formerly known as acute renal failure) is a type of organ failure that is almost always because of pre-renal or renal (acute tubular necrosis) etiology. It is diagnosed by a criteria that is a combination of either increase in serum creatine (laboratory) or severe reduction in urine volume.Presentation: Most prerenal causes have symptoms of reduced urine output associated with decreased tissue perfusion insults (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoes, bleeding, sepsis that have lead to volume depletion, hypotension), while renal causes maybe because of exposure to nephrotoxins including drugs that may have blood and sediments in urine. Tachycardia and signs of uremia may occur.Assessment: Urinalysis, Fractional Extraction of Sodium, Ultrasound of kidney/pelvis. Search for etiology.Plan: eliminate the cause of injury when possible. Maintain renal perfusion and fluid balance. Renal biopsy in some cases.Prognosis: may recover to baseline, or may progress to chronic kidney disease.",,
