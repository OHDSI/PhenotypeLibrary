Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia. Brain cell connections and the cells themselves degenerate and die, eventually destroying memory and other important mental functions. Presentation: Memory loss and confusion (main symptoms). Challenges in planning or solving problems, difficulty competing familar tasks, new problems with words in speaking or writingAssessment: Self-reporting (family reporting) about symptoms, Assessment: of memory and thinking skills, rule out potential causes, brain imagery - CT and MRI, can be diagnosed afer death (microscopic exam of the brain)Plan: treat cognitvie symptoms - Cholinesterase inhibitors (galantamine, rivastigmine and donepezil). memantine). Memantine, an N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, is prescribed to treat moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. Prognosis: Worsens over time, progressive disease. No cure exists, but medications and management strategies may temporarily improve symptoms. Symptoms eventually grow severe enough to interfere with daily tasks.","{
