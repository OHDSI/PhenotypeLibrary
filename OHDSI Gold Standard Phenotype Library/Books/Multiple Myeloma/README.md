# Multiple Myeloma

Multiple myeoma is a cancer of plasma cells, specifically white blood cells in the bone marrow. In patients with multiple myeloma, a group of plasma cells becomes cancerous and multiplies. The disease can damage the bones, immune system, kidneys, and red blood cell count. Symptoms may not be present at all or may be non-specific, such as loss of appetite, bone pain, and fever. Treatments include medications, chemotherapy, corticosteroids, radiation, or a stem-cell transplant.â€‹
