Machine Learning for Rocket Propulsion Health Monitoring
	by Mark Schwabacher

*Model
	-Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Algorithms
*Questions
	-What all do our sensors measure?
	-How redundant are the sensors? For instance, are they grouped to measure the same thing?
	-What information from the sensors and sensor anomalies may be insignificant?
	-How are you currently interpreting the sensor data?
	-Any past sensor data that we can use for training?
*Problems
	-Only used data from the sensors located on the rocket test stand.
	-Algorithms are not specific to time data.


A Survey of Data-Driven Prognostics
	by Mark Schwabacher

*Overview
	- Nice list of different studies and techniques used in ISHM
	- Differentiated by rocket area specifics and learning types
*Questions
	-What parts of the rocket are we most interested in?
	-Are we interested in detection, diagnosis, prognosis, or any combo?


Multi-view Learning Overview: Recent Progress and New Challenges
	by Jing Zhao, Xijiong Xie, Xin Xu, Shiliang Sun

*Overview
	-Data fusion or data integration from multiple feature sets.
		*Would be able to consider the sensor data and the image data has multiple views.
	-Gives an overview of approaches as well as example datasets.
*Questions
	-How much data are we going to have to work with?
	-How complete is the data?


Active Learning Literature Survey
	by Burr Settles

*Overview
	-Survey of active learning techniques and basic ideas
*Problems
	-Can the other researchers classify the rocket images from data?
	-Is it time efficient?


Health Monitoring of Rocket Engines using Image Processing
	by P.J. Disimile, B. Shoe, N. Toy

*Overview
	- Similar to our original idea.
	- Does not use sensor data at all.
	- Pretty technical in terms of the rockets themselves.
	- Would at least be useful as a baseline.
	- Old Paper


Rocket Engine Health Monitoring using a Model-Based Approach
	- John P. Butas, Claudia M. Meyer, Louis M. Santi, T. Shane Sowers

*Overview
	- Model design using sensor data.
	- Possibly could combine with the Image Processing paper.
	- Possible test dataset as well.
	- Also analyzes missing sensor data.


Approach to Space Shuttle Main Engine Health Monitoring using Plume Spectra
	by David A. Benzing, Kevin W. Whitaker

*Questions
	-What type of species can we expect from flame emissions?
	-Is metal erosion a concern with the launch?

*Overview
	-Uses spectral templates of flames to discover anomalies
	-Added together with sensor data

*Model
	-Uses a Neural Network to pinpoint where in the engine the rocket failed


A Survey of Multi-View Machine Learning
	by Shiliang Sun

*Overview
	-Another cursory glance over multiview learning.
	-Different methods can be applied based on the specific problem we want to attack.
	-Additional readings would follow based on our research question.
