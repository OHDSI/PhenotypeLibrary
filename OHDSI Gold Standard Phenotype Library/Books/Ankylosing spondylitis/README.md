# Ankylosing spondylitis

Anklosing Spondylitis (AS) is a class of axial spondyloarthritis (an inflammatory arthritis of the spine) where damage can be detected by X-ray, as opposed to spondyloarthritis with no visible damage, generally referred to as non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-AxSpA)[1].  There have been several studies that have attempted to characterize AS, indicating that the incidence rate has increased over the past 15 years, higher in men, and age of onset in the 30s.[2, 3]  However, studies have shown that the incidence in women is increasing relative to men.[4]
