# Post submission

## Validity Checks
- All submissions get [validity Checks For CohortDefinitions](https://ohdsi.github.io/PhenotypeLibrary/articles/ValidityChecksForCohortDefinitions.html)
  
## Life cycle
- Cohort Definitions that have passed validity checks get put in the pipeline and will be available in the next release.
- If a cohort definition completes peer review, then the version number of the library when it was accepted becomes the *added version*.

## Assignment for Peer Review
- OHDSI will perform on optional open peer review through the OHDSI Phenotype Development and Evaluation workgroup.
- The peer review may be oral feedback (Recorded video sessions in the OHDSI Phenotype Development and Evaluation work group - archived in the workgroup) or written feedback - in forum.
- It is up-to the submitter to then consider the peer review recommendations, make changes, or not.
- Based on the decision of the peer reviewer(s) the cohort definition would be considered accepted.
- Once accepted, the cohort definitions will be made immutable and a version number will be assigned to it. Key peer review notes will usually be referenced (commonly to the forum post).
