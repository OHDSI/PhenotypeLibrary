# Post submission

## Validity Checks prior to consideration
- All submissions get [validity Checks For CohortDefinitions](https://ohdsi.github.io/PhenotypeLibrary/articles/ValidityChecksForCohortDefinitions.html)
- Your submission is expected to pass these tests prior to being posted into atlas-phenotype.ohdsi.org
  
## Addition to [Atlas-phenotype] (https://atlas-phenotype.ohdsi.org/)
- If your cohort definition passes the validity checks, it is now eligible to be posted to [Atlas-phenotype] (https://atlas-phenotype.ohdsi.org/) and be part of the [OHDSI Phenotype Library] (https://github.com/OHDSI/PhenotypeLibrary)  in the next maintenance cycle.
- Till your cohort definition has not completed the peer review cycle, it will be flagged as 'Under review'. During this time, you are allowed to make alterations to your cohort definition. Please note: not all alterations are captured in PhenotypeLibrary R package, as it only takes a snapshot of the definition on the maintenance date. The field *added version* will continue to be empty till your cohort definition is accepted.

## Assignment for Peer Review
- OHDSI will perform on open peer review through the OHDSI Phenotype Development and Evaluation workgroup.
- Workgroup members are assigned as peer reviewers. The peer review may be oral feedback (Recorded video sessions in the OHDSI Phenotype Development and Evaluation work group - archived in the workgroup) or written feedback - in forum.
- It is up-to the submitter to then consider the peer review recommendations, make changes, or not.
- Based on the decision of the peer reviewer(s) the cohort definition would be considered accepted.
- Once accepted, the cohort definitions will be made immutable and a version number will be assigned to it. Key peer review notes will usually be referenced (commonly to the forum post).
