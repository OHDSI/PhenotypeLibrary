It is a state of 'relative' insulin deficiency - where insulin even when present may be less effective due to resistance. Presentation: The classic symptoms of hyperglycemia (including polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, blurred vision, and weight loss) but these are most commonly observered in retrospect with most common mode of diagnosis is screening in asymptomatic patients, or seeking emergency care for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state without ketoacidosis. Assessment: Oral glucose tolerance test and HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, lipid, liver function testsPlan: Initial management is achieve normoglycemic state with lifestyle modification - weight, diet.

201965000,201965000,201965000,Shock,201965,"Overview: Four types of non mutually exclusion shocks are recognized: distributive (septic, non septic - anaphylatic, neurogenic, SIRS), cardiogenic (cardiomyopathic - MI, arrythomogenic, mechanical), hypovolemic (hemorrhagic, non-hemorrhagic - diarrhoea, vomiting), and obstructive (pulmonary embolism, tension pneumothorax, pericardial tamponade, constrictive pericarditis). Cardiogenic shock is a subtype of shock phenotype where there is inability of the heart to pump an adequate amount of blood leading to decreased oxygen and nutrient delivery to the tissues and, if tissue perfusion reduction is prolonged, potentially end-organ damage and multi-system failure. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) with left ventricular failure is the most common cause of cardiogenic shock. Cardiogenic shock is the leading cause of death in patients with acute MI. Cardiogenic shock has persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure <80 to 90 mmHg or mean arterial pressure 30 mmHg lower than baseline) with severe reduction in the cardiac index (<1.8 L/min per m2 without support or <2 to 2.2 L/min per m2 with support) with adequate filling pressures. Other causes of cardiogenic shock include acute mitral valve regurgitation, rupture of ventricular septal or free walls, cardiac tamponade. Septic shock is a subtype of shock phenotype with distributive type of shock. SIRS is a clinical syndrome that is characterized by a robust inflammatory response to infectious (or non infectious) insult. Sepsis, defined as a dysregulated host response to infection resulting in life-threatening organ dysfunction. There is a continuum of severity ranging from sepsis to septic shock. Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome is a type of sepsis and a type of septic shock. Presentation: The cardinal features of shock, irrespective of shock type, include clinical manifestations of hypoperfusion such as hypotension (which occurs in most patients), oliguria, abnormal mental status, cold clammy skin, and evidence of metabolic acidosis on laboratory testing. The ""classic"" patient with cardiogenic shock has severe systemic hypotension, signs of systemic hypoperfusion (eg, cool extremities, oliguria, and/or alteration in mental status), and respiratory distress due to pulmonary congestion. Shock is a physiologic continumm that begins with inciting event that triggers physiological changes. Pre-shock/compensated shock is characterized by compensatory responses to diminished tissue perfusion - tachycardia, peripheral vasoconstriction, elevated systemic blood pressure. Shock - compensatory mechanisms are overwhelmed, organ dysfunction may start with dyspnea, restlessnes, diaphoresis, metabolic acidosis, hypotension. End-organ dysfunction including anuria, acute renal failure, acidemia, comma, death. Cardiogenic shock presentation is similar to other forms of shock (see shock phenotype) along with evidence of myocardial insult to explain the shock such as MI. Most patients who develop cardiogenic shock due to acute MI do so after hospital admission for MI because of eventual failure of intial compensatory mechanisms that protected the individual from hemodynamic failure with about 50% developing within 24 hours of infarct. Sepsis shock may be expected to have sepsis symptoms such as fever, tachycardia, elevated respiratory rate, abnormal white blood count, and severely ill looking.  Assessment: find the cause, evaluate for septic or cardiogenic or other causes. Diagnosis of cardiogenic shock requires strong clinical judgment by looking for some combination of difficulty breathing, hypotension, hypoperfusion, pulmonary congestion - supported by ECG abnormalality, chest x ray with pulmonary congestion, and wall motion abnormality on echocardiogram. To identify infection in suspected sepsis - blood/urine/sputum cultures, wound cultures if a wound present, lumbar puncture if indicated clinically,lactate level. Plan: Treat as emergency. ICU admission, hemodynamic monitoring with pulmonary artery catheterization if needed, vasopressor drugs (norepinephrine, dopamine), supplemental oxygen/ventilatory support, pH managment of lactic acidosis. Treat the cause. Cardiogenic shock- diagnostic coronary angiography, attempt reperfusion of heart if MI, coronary artery revascularization. fluid replenishment, hemodynamic monitoring and management, airway management and ventillation. For sepsis - may need to start with broad spectrum antibiotics after cultures are drawn (even when pending), and then narrow antibiotics based on results of susceptibility testing. Prognosis: highly variable.

321319000,321319000,321319000,Cardiomyopathy,321319,"Overview: Cardiomyopathies were originally defined as disorders that were idiopathic, but in North American clinical practice the terms ""ischemic,"" ""valvular,"" and ""hypertensive cardiomyopathy"" were commonly used causing dismbiguation. Multiple attempts were made including2006 AHA scientific statement definition ""Cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous group of diseases of the myocardium associated with mechanical and/or electrical dysfunction that usually (but not invariably) exhibit inappropriate ventricular hypertrophy or dilation and are due to a variety of causes that frequently are genetic. Cardiomyopathies either are confined to the heart or are a part of generalized systemic disorders, often leading to cardiovascular death or progressive heart failure-related disability."" Two groups: primary cardiomyopathies (predominantly involving the heart) and secondary cardiomyopathies (accompanied by other organ system involvement). The primary cardiomyopathies are subdivided into genetic, mixed (predominantly nongenetic), or acquired (nongenetic). The genetic cardiomyopathies include Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D), left ventricular noncompaction, PRKAG2 and Danon glycogen storage diseases, conduction defects, mitochondrial myopathies, and ion channel disorders. The mixed cardiomyopathies include Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM). The acquired cardiomyopathies include myocarditis, stress-induced (takotsubo), peripartum, tachycardia-induced, and infants of insulin-dependent diabetic mothers. This was followed in 2008 by ESC, as ""A myocardial disorder in which the heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal in the absence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular disease and congenital heart disease sufficient to explain the observed myocardial abnormality"". The clinical ideas describing the breadth of cardiomyopathy is still evolving but functionally echocardiogram evaluation is a functional way to classify cardiomyopathy into either  dilated, hypertrophic, arrhythmogenic right ventricular, or restrictive cardiomyopathy. Systolic dysfunction is characterized by a decrease in myocardial contractility, i.e. myocardial contractility is decreased globally and commonly compensated thru LV enlargementi.e. dilated cardiomyopathy. Diastolic dysfunction refers to cardiac dysfunction in which LV relaxation and filling is abnormal and is accompanied by elevated filling pressures (eg, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, LV noncompaction), valvular heart disease, pericardial disease. Some cardiac disorders may present as more than one type of cardiomyopathy e.g. amyloid cardiomyopathy with both hypertrophic and restrictive. Cardiac sarcoidosis with wall motion abnormality and ventricular arrythmias. DCM, with Left ventricular cavity dilatation, is associated with viruses and gene mutations. some definitions exclude ischemic cardiomyopathy which appears similar to DCM. In general HCM, would not include pathologic hypertrophy secondary to pathologic loading conditions such as hypertension and valve disease. Atheletes heart, i.e. physiologic cardiomyopathy is not considered cardiomyopathy. RCM is characterized by nondilated ventricles with impaired ventricular filling, commonly without muscle hypertrophy but wall may appear thick because of infiltrative disease (amyloidosis) or storage disease (Fabry). Stress Cardiomyopathy, aka apical ballooning syndrome, takotsubo cardiomyopathy, broken heart syndrome, and stress-induced cardiomyopathy, is a type of acquired cardiomyopathy characterized by transient regional systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle (LV), mimicking myocardial infarction, but in the absence of angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease or acute plaque rupture. In most cases of stress cardiomyopathy, the regional wall motion abnormality extends beyond the territory perfused by a single epicardial coronary artery. Presentation: Cardiomyopathy may present with broad set of signs and symptoms including fatigure, dyspnea, chest pain, palpitations, presyncope and syncope and depends on whether the person is functional vs decompensated. Assessment: ECG often with QTc prolongation greather than 500 ms; ecocardiogram, urgent coronary angiography (for this diagnosis, there needs to be an absence of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease). Troponin and BNP or proBNP serial levels. Plan: Highly personalized care. Manage heart failure, arrythmias, rehabilitation, education. Anticoagulation sometimes indicated. Prognosis: depends on degree of damage. Many with HCM may have normal life expectancy. Prognosis: worse with older age and abnormal left heart pump function (LVEF<40%). Risk of sudden cardiac death.

There are three subtypes : Acute symptomatic seizure refers to a seizure that occurs at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult;  Unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure of unknown etiology as well as one that occurs in relation to a preexisting brain lesion or progressive nervous system disorder; Epilepsy (or epilepsy syndrome) - Two or more distinct unprovoked seizure > 24 hours apart,  or a tendency to have recurrent seizures is epilepsy. Seizures are either focal or generalized (various types), or unknown onset. Most seizures can be categorized as either focal or generalized according to whether the onset of electrical activity involves a focal region of the brain or both sides of the brain simultaneously. Presentation: mild to severe, temporary confusion, staring spell, uncontrollable jerking movements of arms/legs, loss of awareness/consciousness, cognitive or emotional symptoms, such as fear, anxiety or deja vu. Assessment: is to determine if cause of seizure because of a systemic insult (i.e. potentially reversible e.g. metabolic derangements, drug or alcohol withdrawal) or an intrinsic dysfunction of the central nervous system (i.e. underlying brain pathology and long-term). The later is also commonly unprovoked seizures. Compared with children and young adults, older adults with a first seizure are more likely to have a cause of seizure identified by an initial evaluation and neuroimaging..

Encephalitis commonly overlaps with meningitis, and although the term meningoencephalitis exists it is common for patients to misclassified as having only meningitis when there is underlying encephalitis. Viral encephalitis may be due to primary infection for the central nervous system by the virus, or postinfectious encephalitis (acute disseminated encephalomyeltis ADEM, probably immune mediated response including demyelination, more common in children) where a virus cannot be detected in neurons. Herpes simplex 1 is the most common viral etiology for viral encephalitis. Post vaccination encephalitis can occur if live attenuated viral vaccines given to people with immune compromise. Non viral etiologies like primary intracranial or metastatic tumors, adverse effects of medications, and autoimmune or paraneoplastic diseases may mimic viral encephalitis. Presentation:  Range of symptoms from subtle mental status changess to unresponsiveness in the absence of meningeal irritation (unless meningoencephalitis is present). Altered mental status (ranging from confusion to obtunded), seizures, and focal neurologic abnormalities including hemiparesis, cranial nerve palsies, exaggerted DTRs or pathologic reflexes. ADEM symptoms start after a lag time of a few days to two months, with the typical presentation of acute onset of multifocal neurologic symptoms with encephalopathy with rapid deterioration prompting hospitalization. Most ADEM patients have motor deficits (single or multiple limb paralysis), sensory deficits, and brainstem dysfunction (oculomotor deficits). Encephalopathy is not required for diagnosis in adults, but required in children. Assessment: Workup for West Nile Virus, evaluate for rash, rabies, varicella zoster virus, parotitis (mumps encephalitis). MRI during acute illness to r/o space occupying lesions and to guide further diagnostics/therapeutics. Temporal lobe involvement on MRI supports HSV, which can be confirmed by HSV PCR from LP. Lumbar puncture with opening pressure, cell count, glucose and protein, HIV and enteroviruses. It is important to know the patients immune status as this will determine both the presentation and the type of pathogen that might be causing the disease (i.e. opportunistic infections like toxoplasmic encephlitis and cryptococcal meningitis). Plan: Acyclovir initiated until HSV encephalitis is ruled out, withdrawl of possible offending drugs, r/o delerium. ADEM is managed with immune suppression with glucocorticoids; empiric acyclovir until infectious etiology excluded, IVIG or plasma exchange for treatment failures. Supportive care.

Most strokes are caused by an abrupt blockage of arteries leading to the brain (ischemic stroke). Other strokes are caused by bleeding into brain tissue when a blood vessel bursts (hemorrhagic stroke). Also - Transient ischemic attack (a warning or “mini-stroke”). Presentation: trouble walking, speaking, and understanding; paralysis or numbness of the face, arm, or leg, severe headache, vision changes Assessment: Physical exam, blood tests (clotting); imaging, CT scan, MRI; carotid ultrasound, cerebral angiogram, echo Plan: Depends on stroke type -antiplatelet, anticoagulants, clot buster (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)), endovascular procedures; carotid endarterectomy, angioplasty and stents; surgery Prognosis: Medical emergency. early treatment minimizes brain damage.

381591000,381591000,381591000,Cerebrovascular disease,381591,"Overview: Cerebrovascular disease (subsumes cerebrovascular accident) are a group of conditions that affect the cerebral vasculature and blood flow, resulting in or predisposing to cerebrovascular accident/stroke (includes vascular anomalies - both congenital and acquired , av malformations, capillary telangiectasia etc). A stroke (cerebrovascular accident) is a highly variable clinical condition (clinical diagnosis supported by testing) defined as abrupt onset of a neurologic deficit that is attributatble to a focal vascular cause (i.e. cerebrovascular disease). Cerebral ischemia is caused by reduction in blood flow to brain tissue for more than a few seconds - because neurons lack glycogen, energy failure rapidly ensures and neurologic symptoms manifest in seconds. If cessation of blood flow lasts for more than a few minutes - cerebral infarction (brain tissue death) may occur. If blood supply is restored before infarction, full recovery is possible - transient ischemic attack (TIA). TIA is defined as all neurologic signs and symptoms resolved within 24hr without evidence of brain infarction on brain imaging (most < 1hr). Stroke is said to have occurrred if the neurologic signs and symptoms persist for > 24hr or brain infarction is seen on imaging. A generalized reduction in cerebral blood flow (e.g. systemic hypotension due to arrythmia, myocardial infarction) usually produces syncope, and if long enough may lead to globa hypoxia-ischemia encephalopathy - this is not stroke because it is not focal vascular disease. Stroke syndrome may occur because of focal ischemia/infarction (obstruction of vessel) or intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding into or around brain with ischemic neurologic symptoms secondary to mass effect, increased intracranial pressure or toxins). Seizure, intracrainal tumor, migraine, metabolic encephalopathy may mimic stroke - but is not stroke. Stroke syndromes are divided (based on vasculature) into - large-vessel stroke within anterior circulation (internal carotid artery and branches - middle cerebral artery, anterior cerebral artery, anterior choroidal artery, internal carotid artery, common carotid artery), large-vessel stroke within posterior circulation (basillar artery, vertebral artery, internal cerebellar artery), small-vesssel disease(old name lacunar stroke) of either vascular bed. Ischemic penumbra - tissue around core area of infarction with reversible ischemia. Thrombotic (ischemic) strokes are those in which the pathologic process giving rise to thrombus formation in an artery produces a stroke either by reduced blood flow distally (low flow) or by an embolic fragment that breaks off and travels to a more distant vessel (artery-to-artery embolism). Embolic strokes are divided into four categories (known cardiac source, possible cardiac or aortic source, arterial source, unknown source). Hemorrhagic stroke are classifed based on location - intracranial hemorrhage (ICH - parenchymal hemorrhage), subdural and epidural hemorrhage (later two mostly due to trauma induced vessel damage). Intracranial hemorrhage is divided into hypertensive ICH (commonly spontaneous rupture of small artery) or large lobar hemorrhage (e.g. temporal hemorrhage). Presentation: Highly variable. stroke - facial droop, arm weakness, speech difficulty. headache, vertigo, N/V, confusion, arm/leg/face numbness, difficult to walk. Small vessel ischemic stroke usually present as pure motor hemoiparesis, pure sensory stroke, ataxic hemiparesis, dyarthria and clumsy limbs. Hemorrhagic stroke is more commonly associated with headache, ischemic stroke is more commonly with seizures. Assessment: the goal is to establish clinical diagnosis and evaluate if hemorrhage or ischemia, so that treatment plan may be initiated. CT head is highly sensitive for hemorrhagic stroke. Initial management does not depend on etiology - establishin etiology helps prevent recurrence. TOAST classification (5 subtypes) is commonly used to establish etiology of ischemic stroke. Histpry & physical, angiogram, ultrasound, CT, EEG, lumbar puncture, MRI. Review history of anticoagulation and need for reversal. Plan: ABC resusciation first. Goal is to prevent or reverse brain injury. Medical support (BP management), IV thrombolysis, endovascular revascularization, antithrombotic therapy (aspirin), neuroprotection, stroke center referal and rehabilitation. Prognosis: can highly impacted by management especially acute management of stroke. After acute management, risk of recurrence needs to be reduced and any long-term sequela addressed through rehabilitation.",,"cerebrovascular disease (with/without prior cerebrovascular accident), TIA, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke,",

Severe RSV disease is #1 reason infants under 1 year of age are hospitalized in the USPresentation: Runny nose, decrease in appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever, and wheezing. Show symptoms within 4 to 6 days after getting infected. Assessment: Mild RSV symptoms are similar to the common cold, testing usually isn't required for diagnosis. However, there are some lab tests to confirm diagnosis, the most common is a mouth swab or a blood test to check white blood cell counts and look for viruses. In severe RSV cases that require hospitalization, additional testing may be needed. Imaging tests, such as a chest X-ray or CT scan can check for lung complications. Blood and urine cultures may be necessary when infants are very sick, as RSV-related bronchiolitis can occur with a urinary tract infection in newborns. Plan: No specific treatment for RSV infection, though researchers are working to develop vaccines and antivirals. Manage fever and pain with OTC fever reducers and pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. There are currently only two drugs approved - Palivizumab is a monoclonal antibody for the prevention of RSV in high-risk children and ribavirin is approved for treatment of severe RSV disease. Prognosis: Most RSV infections go away on their own in a week or two. But some people with RSV infection, especially infants younger than 6 months of age and older adults, may need to be hospitalized if they are having trouble breathing or are dehydrated.

Temporally PE is classified into acute (presenting immediately after obstruction), subacute (within days or weeks following event), chronic (over many years, ie, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension; CTEPH - uncommon). Unless otherwise specified, the general useage of the term pulmonary embolism implies 'acute' PE. Acute PE is further classified based on hemodynamic stability into unstable/massive/high-risk PE if hemodynamically unstable (hypotension), hemodynamically stable with right ventricular strain submassive/intermediate-risk PE, hemodynamically stable and no evidence of right ventricular strain low-risk PE. It is also classified based on the location of the emboli - saddle PE, main lobar, segmental or subsegmental. Most emboli are thought to originate from lower extremity proximal veins (iliac, femoral, and popliteal). Presentation: Highly variable and may occassionally be asymptomatic and found incidentally (especially chronic variant). Most commonly starts with a combination of chest pain (classically pleuritic in nature), cough, and symptoms of deep venous thrombosis. The symptoms of PE are secondary to pathophysiologic responses like tissue infarction, abnormal gas exchange, cardivascular compromise with sudden shortness of breath and chest pain - to shock and death. Assessment: Hard diagnosis in hemodynamically stable patients - often guided by prior probability based on at-risk (Wells criteria). D-dimer testing and definitive diagnostic imaging (CT pulmonary angiography). V/Q scan is less commonly used. If hemodynamically unstable, definitive diagnostic imaging may not be practical or safe. Plan: If hemodynamically unstable, resusistative efforts (oxygenation, stabilization, ventillatory support, hemodynamic support). Once diagnosis is confirmed, main therapy is anticoagulants (sometimes started prior to diagnosis when pretest probability is high). If the emboli is considered life threatening, then thrombolysis, inferior vena cava filters, or embolectomy surgery. Prognosis: Death may occur, but mortality is reduced with anticoagulation.

Kidney damage refers to pathologic abnormalities, whether established via kidney biopsy or imaging studies, or inferred from markers such as urinary sediment abnormalities or increased rates of urinary albumin excretion. Acute Kidney Injury (formerly known as acute renal failure) is a type of organ failure (usually reversible) that is almost always because of pre-renal or renal (acute tubular necrosis) etiology, and is diagnosed by a criteria that is a combination of either increase in serum creatine (laboratory) or severe reduction in urine volume. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a heterogeneous group of common chronic disorders characterized by alterations in kidney structure and function, which a range of severity manifestation that depend on the underlying cause and rate & degree of loss of kidney function. CKD is defined by the presence of kidney damage or decreased kidney function for three or more months, irrespective of the cause, and this persistence of the damage or decreased function for at least three months is necessary to distinguish CKD from acute kidney disease. History of kidney transplantation even if normal kidney function is CKD. The term ""end-stage kidney disease"" (ESKD) generally refers to chronic kidney failure treated with either dialysis or transplantation. Presentation: Acute Kidney injury due to prerenal causes have symptoms of reduced urine output associated with decreased tissue perfusion insults (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoes, bleeding, sepsis that have lead to volume depletion, hypotension), while those due to renal causes such as exposure to nephrotoxins including drugs that may have blood and sediments in urine, with tachycardia and signs of uremia. Chronic Kidney Disease is usually asymptomatic in its early stages, as symptoms appear in later stages of disease or secondary to complications. In some cases patient may be diagnosed with CKD, when an asymptomatic CKD decompensates and manifests as acute (exacerbation of chronic) kidney disease. CKD disease is commonly recognized by hormonal and metabolic complications such as anemia and hyperparathyroidism, as the symptoms and signs are non-specific such as fatigue, hypertension, electrolyte imbalances, dyspnea and abnormal heart rhythm. Assessment: Establish if acute or chronic. If acute, look for life threatening situations like fluid overload - pulmonary edema, uremic syndrome, hyperkalemia, cardiac arrythmias, electrolytes, EKG.If CKD staging is performed using a combination of kidney damage (albuminuria) and function (GFR), and represent those with more severe disease and thus higher risk for progression and complications. Cause of CKD is essential part of assessment and is an indicator of prognosis. Assessment for kidney damage (albuminuria, urinary sediments, imaging changes, biopsy findings of glomerular, vascular or tubulointerstial disease, history of kidney transplantation even if normal kidney funciton is CKD). Kidney function - GFR is the best indicator and decling GFR is hallmark of progressive CKD. < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 is diagnostics, < 15 mL/min per 1.73 m2 or treatment by dialysis is kidney failure. CKD classification is based on etiology, GFR stages (6 sub categories G1 >= 90, G2 60 to 89, G3a 45 to 59, G3b 30 to 44, G4 15 to 29, G5 < 15), Albuminuria stages (A1 < 30, A2 30 to 300, A3 > 300).

A primarily pediatric condition that is an IgA mediated vasculitis most commonly seen in ages 3-15 years, with predominant occurrence in winter often one to two weeks after a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Presentation: Disease is characterized by tetrad of manifestations of palpable purpura in patients with neither thrombocytopenia nor coagulopathy, arthritis/arthralgia, abdominal pain and renal disease. Palpable purpura (raised purple lesions) symmetrically distributed over legs and buttocks, trunk usually spared. Swelling and joint pain affecting ankles and knees most commonly. Abdominal pain and severe GI disorders are rare but significant sequelae. Assessment: The diagnosis of IgAV is typically based upon clinical manifestations of the disease (palpable purpura without thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy and two or three of the remaining clinical features: arthritis/arthralgia, abdominal pain, and renal disease). However, the classic rash of IgAV is not the initial presenting sign in approximately one-quarter of affected individuals.  It may be difficult to make the diagnosis of IgAV prior to the appearance of a rash in patients who present with other clinical manifestations, such as abdominal pain or arthritis, particularly in isolation. In patients with incomplete or unusual presentations, a biopsy of an affected organ (eg, skin or kidney) that demonstrates leukocytoclastic vasculitis with a predominance of IgA deposition confirms the diagnosis of IgAV. CMP, UA for protein, red blood cells, casts. Skin biopsy for IgA deposition in small vessel walls if needed. Plan: Corticosteroids for abdominal symptoms and prevention of abdominal complications. If IgAV nephritis is present, steroids and other immunosuppressive drugs have been used. Evaluate for infection including Hep A and B, mycoplasma.

4137275000,4137275000,4137275000,Vasculitis,4137275,"Overview: (plural: vasculitides) are serious and sometimes fatal diseases that require prompt recognition and therapy. They are defined by the presence of inflammatory leukocytes in vessel walls (sign of inflammation) with reactive damage to mural structures that may lead to compromised lumen with restriction of blood flow to tissues and associated acute or chronic organ/tissue damage. Also known as angiitis and arteritis - the naming conventions are changing with eponyms being replaced. Most important recent name changes include 'eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis EGPA' for Churg-Strauss syndrome; 'granulomatosis with polyangiitis GPA' for Wegener's granulomatosis; 'immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis IgAV' for Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP); 'anti-C1q vasculitis' for 'hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis'; 'cryoglobulinemic vasculitis' for essential cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) includes three disorders - microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), GPA, and EGPA. Non-infectious vasculitides are classified primarily by the predominant vessel involved - although some forms of vasculitis may not show predilection to one vessel type. Large Vessel Vasculitis (Takayasu’s arteritis, Giant cell arteritis); Medium vessel arteritis (polyarteritis nodosa, Kawasaki disease - mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome); Small vessel vasculitis (ANCA associated vasculitis, MPA (GPA, EGPA), Immune complex small vessel vasculitis (anti glomerular basement membrane disease - GBM, Cryoglobulinemic, IgA, anti-C1a; variable vessel (Behçet , Cogan).  Single organ cutaneous vasculitis (Cutaneous small vessel vasculitis) is a syndrome defined as a single-organ, skin-isolated small vessel vasculitis or angiitis, without systemic vasculitis or glomerulonephritis i.e. without the involvement of other organ systems such as the heart, lungs, GI system, kidney or arthritis - and may be due to medication exposure (common etiology) such as penicillins, cephalosporins, sulfonamides (including most loop and thiazide-type diuretics), phenytoin, and allopurinol, or infections such as Hepatitis B/C, HIV, chronic bacteremias like endocarditis, shunts. Kawasaki's, aka mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome is a vasculitides of childhood (rare in adults), typically self-limited with fever and inflammation lasting about 2 weeks without therapy, but may lead to complications such as coronary artery aneurysms, heart failure, myocardial infarction, arrythmia, peripheral arterial occlusion.  Henoch-Schönlein purpura is the most common form of systemic vasculitis in children, a primarily pediatric condition that is an IgA mediated vasculitis most commonly seen in ages 3-15 years, with predominant occurrence in winter often one to two weeks after a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Presentation: Vasculitis is rare but should be considered in patients who present with systemic or constitutional symptoms in combination with evidence of single and/or multiorgan dysfunction. Include, fever, headache, fatigue, wt loss, general aches and pains, night sweats, rash, numbness or weakness. Behçet is associated with painful, recurrent oral ulcers M > F. Kawasaki has fever (> 5 days) with signs of mucocutaneous inflammation (fissured lips, injected pharynx, strawberry tongue, mucositis), bilateral bulbar conjunctival injection, erythema of palms or soles, edema, desquamation of periungual areas, polymorphous rash, cervical lymphadenopathy, arthritis. Henoch-Schönlein purpura is characterized by tetrad of manifestations of palpable purpura  (raised purple lesions, symmetrically distributed over legs and buttocks, trunk usually spared) in patients with neither thrombocytopenia nor coagulopathy, arthritis/arthralgia, abdominal pain and renal disease. Assessment: C-reactive protein, CBC, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies test, urinalysis, x-rays, ultrasound, CT, MRI, PET, angiography, biopsy (affected area). Plan: Control the inflammation and resolve underlying disease triggering the vasculitis. If due to external exposure, identify and discontinue. Remission induction and remission maintenance using corticosteroids, steroid-sparing meds. Disease specific treatments are possible for some sub-types. Maintenance may include surgery if vasculitis caused an aneurysm or blocked arteries. Prognosis: Limited data. Depends on type of vasculitis and organs involved and how serious. Some initial success with treatment, some have flare-ups, and some vasculitis does not go away and requires ongoing treatment. IVIG for Kawasaki’s may reduce complications such as coronary artery aneurysm. Henoch-Schönlein purpura is typically self limited.",,,

If myocardial inflammation is also present  then the term myopericarditis or perimyocarditis is used. Presentation: Sharp chest pain improved by sitting up and leaning forward. If pericardiatis is due to infection, fever may be present. Assessment: Auscultation for pericardial friction rub; ECG showing widespread ST elevations, chest x ray, cardiac markers (troponin) elevation, pericardiocentesis/pericardial biopsy, CBC, sed rate, CRP, echocardiography. Blood cultures for fever, rheumatology workup in young women. Plan: NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) with colchicine or aspirin. If this treatment fails, further workup needed to rule out atypical forms of pericarditis including tuberculosis, cancer, and inflammatory disease. Most low risk patients may be managed in ambulatory settings, high risk patients need to be hospitalized. High risk features include fever, sub-acute onset, hemodynamic compromise/cardiac tamponade, immunosuppression, on anticoagulant therapy, acute trauma, elevated cardiac enzymes. Prognosis: Patients with acute idiopathic or viral pericarditis have a good long-term prognosis - typically self-limited over 2 weeks with NSAID treatment resulting in good long-term prognosis. Cardiac tamponade rarely occurs in patients with acute idiopathic pericarditis and is more common in patients with a specific underlying etiology such as malignancy, tuberculosis, or purulent pericarditis. Constrictive pericarditis may occur in approximately 1 percent of patients with acute idiopathic pericarditis and is also more common in patients with a specific etiology.",,cohort definition for each subtype,

This is distinct from Acute Coronary syndrome (acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina). Although a few people in this category may have acute (unstable) disease, the vast majority have a chronic (stable) disease - stable ischemic heart disease. Unless otherwise specified, this phenotype describes individuals with such chronic stable disease. While some may have history of prior myocardial infaction, others may have had silent infarction of heart that was incidentally found. An important subtype is left main coronary artery disease (LMCAD) and is a diagnosis made via coronary arteriography, and maybe suggested based on ECG pattern on stress testing. Left main equivalent disease, defined as severe (≥70 percent) proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and proximal left circumflex disease. Presentation: People with this disease may have Angina pectoris, chest discomfort that occurs predictably and reproducibly at a certain level of exertion and is relieved with rest or nitroglycerin. Many maybe asymptomatic with symptoms only detected in stress testing. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia frequently present. Assessment: extent and severity of coronary disease can be assessed by stress testing, cardiac imaging, and angiography. history or pathologic Q waves on an electrocardiogram, or wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram may help identify old myocardial infarction. Plan:  secure the diagnosis, assess the extent of disease, relieve symptoms, and prevent future cardiac events such as acute coronary syndromes. Risk reduction (control of hypertension, lipids, weight loss, control of diabetes, exercise, antiplatelet therapy), antianginal therapy use of nitrites. Decrease cardiac demands with calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, supportive care. If LMCAD is detected, strong consider revascularization including coronary artery bypass graft. Prognosis: Coronary artery disease can lead to fatal myocardial infarction without adequate management. Most patients with significant LMCAD are symptomatic and are at higher risk of cardiovascular events, without revascularization, three-year survival is as low as 30% - CABG is recommended over PCI (controversial).",,,

Meningitis may cause lethargic or distractions by headache, but cerebral function is normal - without altered mental status, motor or sensory deficits, altered behavior and personality changes, and speech or movement disorders. Seizures and postictal states can be seen with meningitis alone and should not be construed as definitive evidence of encephalitis. Assessment: Lumbar puncture (opening pressure, cell differential and count less than 250/microliter, modest elevation in CSF protein, normal CSF glucose, bacterial cultures including syphillis and Lyme, viral (HIV, Varicella, mumps, West Nile, enteroviruses) and fungal studies). If no cause found, consider drug induced meningitis (NSAIDs, IVIG, Bactrim) or malignancy - diagnosis of exclusion.

The etiology for CLD is broad to include alcoholic liver disease (including alcoholic fatty liver, alcohol hepatitis), non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD NASH), Chronic Viral Hepatitis (B, C, D), genetic (alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency esp children, hereditary hemochromatosis - excessive iron abosrption, wilsons disease - copper accumulation), automimmune causes (primary biliar cirrhosis PBC, primary sclerosing cholangitis PSC, autoimmune hepatitis AIH), long term drug exposure (amiodarone, isoniazid, methotrexate, phenytoin, nitrofurantoin), Vascular (Budd chiari syndrome). It may also be due to idiopathic or cryptogenic reasons. Presentation: highly variable and depends on the degree of destruction of liver function - but most commonly asymptomatic and detected incidentally or during screening (e.g. hepatitis). Hepatitis may occassionally be associated non specific right upper quadrant pain or discomfort. Most commonly patients are found to have mild elevated liver enzymes on screening test, that when further evaluated leads to etiologic diagnosis. Decompesation (e.g. chronic liver failure) is associated with portal hypertension (variceal bleeding, hematemesis, melena), thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, jaundice - ascities with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatitic encephalopathy (lactulose/rifampin). Primary sclerosing cholangitis has cholestatic pattern (elevated serum alkaline phosphatase, abrnomal bile ducts thickening, dilataion, strictures). Assessment: livery biopsy is considered gold standard to measure fibrosis and cirrhosis, but is now increasingly being replaced by non invasive methods (elastrography). Screen for viral hepatitis. Liver ultrasound. Plan: find the etiology and treat the cause where possible. e.g. antiviral, hep C - 3 months negative = cure. Cirrhosis - prevent decompensation. Autoimmune - induce remission (steroids, azathioprine). Decompensated cirrhosis - liver transplantation.",,,

Diverticulitis is defined as inflammation of a diverticulum. A diverticulum is a sac-like protrusion of the colonic wall. Diverticulosis is defined by the presence of diverticula. Diverticulosis may be asymptomatic or symptomatic. Diverticular disease is defined as clinically significant and symptomatic diverticulosis due to diverticular bleeding, diverticulitis, segmental colitis associated with diverticula, or symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease. Diverticulitis is a sub-type of diverticular disease that maybe acute or chronic, uncomplicated or complicated (abscess, fistula, bowel obstruction, perforation). Acute diverticulitis is defined as inflammation, generally considered to be due to microperforation of a diverticulum. Simple or uncomplicated diverticulitis is defined as acute diverticulitis without an associated complication. Complicated diverticulitis is defined as diverticulitis with one of the following associated complications: bowel obstruction, abscess, fistula, or perforation. Diverticular bleeding may be painless hematochezia. Segmental colitis is inflammation in the interdiverticular mucosa without involving diverticular orifice. Symptomatic diverticular disease may have pain without observable inflammation. Presentation: Approximately 4% of diverticulosis develop acute diverticulitis.

43021132000,43021132000,43021132000,Toxic metabolic encephalopathy,43021132,"Overview: aka encephalopathy, ICU syndrome, ICU psychosis. Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy (TME) is an acute condition of global cerebral dysfunction without primary structural brain disease that encompasses delirium and acute confusional state. it is thought to be due to organic stress on CNS during critical illness. TME is common among critically ill patients, and is usually a consequence of systemic illness. Alcohol withdrawl syndrome related delirium is not included. Specific subtypes - septic encephalopathy, hepatic encephalopathy, uremic encephalopathy, hyponatremic or hypernatremic encephalopathy, wernicke encephalopathy - confusion, ataxia and opathalmoplegia, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, posst transplanation encephalopathy. Exclude other causes such as alcohol withdrawl, meningitis, encephalitis, brain tumors, nonconvulsive seizures, traumatic brain injury, right hemisphere stroke, etc. Presentation: non specific, but with some combination of confusion and delirium - more common in older individuals. Confusion is inability to maintain a coherent stream of thought or action. Delirium is a confusional state with superimposed hyperactivity of the sympathetic limb of the autonomic nervous system with consequent signs including tremor, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and mydriasis. In TME, level of alertness is an indicator of severity. Assessment: lumbar puncture to exclude meningitis. EEG may show global cerebral dysfunction and exclude subclinical seizures. CT/MRI of brain. Plan: treat the underlying cause. physical restraints if needed. Haloperidol for agitation. Thiamine for history of alcoholism, malnutrition, cancer, renal failure etc. Prognosis: depends on the underlying cause. In rare cases may progress into structural brain damage.",,,

Presentation: For taste - reports may be of diminished (hypogeusia), absent (ageusia), altered (dysgeusia), disturbance (aliageusia) or unpleasant (phanogeusia) in absence of stimuli. Hypogeusia is most common complaint. For smell - hyposmia, ansomia, parosmia or dysosmia. Assessment: search for etiology. Eliminate external causes such as drugs, environment, rule out nutritional and metabolic disorders, nerve damage, psychological. Plan: eliminate the cause. Prognosis: depends on underlying causes. If cause is eliminate, may recover quickly.",,,Y
44784217000,44784217000,44784217000,Cardiac arrhythmia,44784217,"Overview: Normal sinus heart rate originates from the sinus node 60-100 beats (sinus arrythmia -normal arrythmia, sinus tachycardia, sinus bradycardia). An arrhythmia is any rhythm that is not normal sinus rhythm with normal atrioventricular (AV) conduction. Arrythmias are classified in many ways based on rate - tachyarrhythmias vs bradyarrhythmias, regularity (regular vs irregular), location/type of origin (atrial vs ventricular, reentrant), or based on wall motion (flutter vs fibrillation). Common arrythmias (supraventricular - atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, non sinus atrial trachycardia ectopic/reentry/premature beats), AV junction (reentry tachycardia, extrasystoles), Ventricular (sustained/non sustained tachycaria, fibrillation, extrasystole/premature beats). Presentation: Symptom type and severity depends on the type, etiology and rate of arrythmia - symptoms dictates urgency of presentation. Sensation of palpitations, syncope, lightheadedness or dizziness, poor exercise tolerance. Assessment: ECG, Holter ambulatory monitor, CBC to rule out anemia, TSH to rule out thyroid disease, lipids, liver tests, clotting tests, electrolyte CMP especially potassium, BNP to evaluate heart failure, echocardiogram to evaluate for structural heart disease. Plan: Treated according to location of the pathology including medications, pacemaker, defibrillator, radiofrequency catheter ablation, external cardioversion - conversion to sinus rythym, vagal maneuver for sinus tachycardias. Treatment of underlying disease such as anemia or thyrotoxicosis frequently resolves the arrhythmia. Prognosis: When identified early in the course of disease process, good. If not treated, can lead to increased risk of stroke (due to atrial fibrillation), heart failure, death. Specialist involvement recommended for anti arrythmic drug management.",,"cohort definition for sinus tachycaria, bradycardia, AV node conduction abnormality, ventrilcular  fibrillation, flutter, cardiac arrest",
45763653000,45763653000,45763653000,Fracture of bone of hip region,45763653,"Overview: Hip fractures occur when a person breaks the bone between the pelvis and knee and these fractures are known as femoral-neck fractures or intertrochanteric or subtrochanteric fractures. Presentation: With hip fractures patients will often complain of severe hip pain and are unable to walk. The physical examination commonly reveals an abducted and externally rotated hip with leg-length discrepancy. Assessment: Hip fractures are generally done with x-ray but an MRI or bone scan could look for hairline fractures. Plan: Treatment usually involves a combination of surgery, rehabilitation, and medication. The surgical options include internal repair using screws, total hip replacement, and partial hip replacement. Prognosis: A hip fracture is a serious injury with complications that can be life-threatening. Hip fracture has an overall 1-year mortality rate that varies from 14% to 36% among patients aged 65 or above, especially after 5 to 10 years after fracture, and in addition, the survivors have a shorter life expectancy.",,Needs revision - non specific,
46271022000,4030518000,46271022000,Chronic kidney disease,46271022,"Overview: [depcreated in favor of 4030518000, Renal Impairment] Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a heterogeneous group of common disorders characterized by alterations in kidney structure and function, which a range of severity manifestation that depend on the underlying cause . describes the gradual loss of kidney function with care strategies that range from prevention, early detection, to advanced management like transplant and dialysis. The term ""end-stage kidney disease"" (ESKD) generally refers to chronic kidney failure treated with either dialysis or transplantation. CKD is defined by the presence of kidney damage or decreased kidney function for three or more months, irrespective of the cause. This persistence of the damage or decreased function for at least three months is necessary to distinguish CKD from acute kidney disease. Kidney damage refers to pathologic abnormalities, whether established via kidney biopsy or imaging studies, or inferred from markers such as urinary sediment abnormalities or increased rates of urinary albumin excretion. Decreased kidney function refers to a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is usually estimated (eGFR) using serum creatinine and one of several available equations. History of kidney transplantation even if normal kidney funciton is CKD. Presentation: CKD is usually asymptomatic in its early stages, as symptoms appear in later stages of disease or secondary to complications. The disease is commonly recognized by hormonal and metabolic complications such as anemia and hyperparathyroidism. Symptoms and signs are commonly slowly evolving non-specific features such as fatigue, hypertension, electrolyte imbalances, dyspnea and abnormal heart rhythm. Assessment: For kidney damage (albuminuria, urinary sediments, imaging changes, biopsy findings of glomerular, vascular or tubulointerstial disease, history of kidney transplantation even if normal kidney funciton is CKD). Kidney function - GFR is the best indicator and decling GFR is hallmark of progressive CKD. < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 is diagnostics, < 15 mL/min per 1.73 m2 or treatment by dialysis is kidney failure. Evidence of chronicity (with repeat testing) is essential to establish chronicity and rule out acute kidney disease. CKD staging is performed using a combination of kidney damage (albuminuria) and function (GFR), and represent those with more severe disease and thus higher risk for progression and complications. Cause of CKD is essential part of assessment and is an indicator of prognosis. Plan: Is highly varied and depends on the stage and cause of disease. Many early stage may not need a specialist. Prognosis: depends on stage and cause, optimal management can slow down progression with good prognosis.",,,Y
