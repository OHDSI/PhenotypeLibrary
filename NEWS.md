Some fixes to issues with meta data for Cohorts

PhenotypeLibrary 3.22.1
======================

- getPhenotypeLog() now returns the original user submitted cohort name, instead of the name forced by atlas-phenotype. 
- This is in line with the original requirement. It allows for long names, names with special characters.

- Deprecated listPhenotypes(). This was an older function that did the same as getPhenotypeLog() but returned only two fields.

- Added requirement on R (4.10) because tidyverse seems to cause problems with older versions of R.

PhenotypeLibrary 3.22.0

Accepted Cohorts: No cohorts were accepted in this release.

New Cohorts: No new cohorts were added in this release.

Deleted Cohorts: duplicates. Added in error. Deleted 879, 907, 910, 916, 958, 959, 960, 961

Added new function getPlConceptDefinitionSet() . This new function exposes the
    concept sets from all circe compatible cohort definitions that are in the library.
    
Additional computer generated metadata added to cohort definition log.
