<p><strong>Note: This document is a DRAFT guidance.</strong> We request
a succinct clinical description, tailored for individuals with a
background in medical terminology, informatics, or clinical practice, to
enable a shared comprehension of the clinical concept being modeled in
the phenotype. While the following structure is recommended, all fields
are OPTIONAL.</p>
<p>The clinical description often encompasses medical technical terms
pertinent to general pathophysiology, steering clear of extensive
molecular biology discussions. The target audience, potentially
comprising clinicians, is not presumed to have a research methods
background. The goal is not to replicate a medical textbook chapter but
to elucidate the clinical idea succinctly.</p>
<p>This document serves as a valuable input for the phenotyper—the
individual responsible for developing and evaluating the cohort
definition. If the phenotyper is utilizing Atlas for cohort creation,
the clinical description is anticipated to guide and furnish
justifications for the concept set expression, alongside the rules for
entry event criteria, inclusion rules, and exit criteria. Please adhere
to the following structure where possible and appropriate:</p>
