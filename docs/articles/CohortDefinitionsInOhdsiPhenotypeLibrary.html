<p><a href="https://github.com/OHDSI/PhenotypeLibrary" class="external-link">PhenotypeLibrary</a> is
part of <a href="https://ohdsi.github.io/Hades/" class="external-link">HADES</a>. This
document is a summary of changes to the Cohort Definitions in <a href="https://github.com/OHDSI/PhenotypeLibrary" class="external-link">OHDSI Phenotype
Library</a> (Library).</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cohort Id:</strong> The <a href="https://github.com/OHDSI/PhenotypeLibrary" class="external-link">OHDSI Phenotype
Library</a> uses an integer id, called cohort Id to catalog and uniquely
identify all cohort definition algorithm that has been submitted. This
id is assigned by <a href="atlas-phenotype.ohdsi.org">atlas-phenotype</a> and gets propagated
to this R package as part of its maintenance cycle.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Library conventions</strong> We follow some conventions:
At a high level, cohorts are either Accepted or Not Accepted.</p></li>
<li><p>A cohort id (Cohort definition) that has been accepted to the
library are guaranteed to persist as an immutable object. i.e., you may
reference it in your study along with attribution to the authors of the
definition. Example: if you are using OHDSI Phenotype Library ‘All-cause
mortality’ in your study, then you may reference it as <em>See id 25 of
the OHDSI Phenotype Library (replace with future publication
reference)</em>. In your study script, you can use cohort id 25 as an
outcome definition. Accepted cohorts may then be deprecated or marked as
error. Deprecated cohorts [D] are still considered valid cohorts but
based on a scientific peer review feedback an alternate cohort has been
recommended. But, Deprecated cohorts may still be used in OHDSI studies.
It will continue to be immutable and is referenceable. An Error cohort
[E] is an accepted cohort that is known to have an error. This is
equivalent to a soft delete and such cohorts should not be used in OHDSI
studies. However, since it is an accepted cohort, it will continue to
persist and be immutable in the OHDSI library.</p></li>
<li><p>A cohort id that has been submitted but is pending peer review -
and thus not yet accepted to the library is mutable. The cohort
definition may change between releases because the submitter and the
reviewers may be evaluating different versions. But such definitions
persist as immutable objects within a released version of the library.
i.e. A cohort definition of fever that was present in the library as of
version 3.5.0 maybe referenced as <em>See id 6 of the OHDSI Phenotype
Library (replace with future publication reference) version 3.5.0</em>.
Cohorts that are pending peer review, may be withdrawn [W] by the
submitter or the librarian.</p></li>
